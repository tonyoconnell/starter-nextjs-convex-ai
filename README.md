## Convex Backend Setup

### Understanding Convex Integration

This project uses Convex as the backend-as-a-service for real-time data, authentication, and serverless functions. The Convex backend is located in `apps/convex/` and provides:

- **Real-time Database**: Reactive queries that update automatically
- **Authentication**: Secure user management and session handling
- **Serverless Functions**: Backend logic without server management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with the frontend

### Initial Convex Setup

1. **Create a Convex Account**: Sign up at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev) if you haven't already.

2. **Initialize Your Convex Project**:

   ```bash
   cd apps/convex
   bunx convex dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Prompt you to create a new project or connect to an existing one
   - Generate deployment URLs and environment variables
   - Deploy the initial schema and functions
   - Start the development server

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the Convex URL from the terminal output
   cd ../web
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud" > .env.local
   ```

### Convex Development Workflow

**Schema Changes**: Edit `apps/convex/schema.ts` to define your data structure

```typescript
// Example: Adding a new table
export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    email: v.string(),
  }).index('by_email', ['email']),
});
```

**Backend Functions**: Create functions in `apps/convex/` directory

```typescript
// Example: Query function
export const getUsers = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async ctx => {
    return await ctx.db.query('users').collect();
  },
});
```

**Frontend Integration**: Use Convex hooks in React components

```typescript
// Example: Using the query in a component
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/api";

export function UsersList() {
  const users = useQuery(api.users.getUsers);
  return <div>{users?.map(user => <p key={user._id}>{user.name}</p>)}</div>;
}
```

### Convex Authentication

The project includes a complete authentication system:

- **User Registration**: Email/password signup with secure hashing
- **Login/Logout**: Session-based authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Client-side route protection
- **User Management**: Profile updates and session management

Test the authentication:

1. Start the development server
2. Visit `/register` to create an account
3. Visit `/login` to sign in
4. Access `/protected` to see authenticated content

### Convex Deployment

**Development**: `bunx convex dev` - Auto-deploys changes to development environment
**Production**: `bunx convex deploy` - Deploys to production environment

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Cannot connect to Convex"**:

- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is set in `.env.local`
- Check that Convex dev server is running
- Verify your Convex deployment is active

**"Schema validation errors"**:

- Check your schema definition in `apps/convex/schema.ts`
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Use the Convex dashboard to inspect your data

**"Function not found"**:

- Verify function is exported in the correct file
- Check that Convex dev server has recompiled
- Ensure you're importing from the correct API path

## Development Workflow

### BMAD Method

This project follows the BMAD (Before, Model, After, Document) methodology:

1. **Before**: Capture context and requirements
2. **Model**: Use Claude Code for implementation
3. **After**: Verify, test, and refine results
4. **Document**: Update documentation and learnings

### AI-Assisted Development

1. **Setup Chrome DevTools Integration**

   ```bash
   bun chrome:debug      # Start Chrome with debugging
   bun claude:bridge     # Start log capture bridge
   ```

2. **Work with Claude Code**
   - Use CLAUDE.md for project-specific AI guidance
   - Leverage built-in context from documentation
   - Follow established patterns and conventions

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for Convex functions
   - E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Automatic test result capture to Claude

### Deployment

The template is configured for edge deployment on Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (automatic on git push)
git push origin main

# Manual deployment (if needed)
npx wrangler pages deploy apps/web/.vercel/output/static --project-name=your-project

# Deploy Convex backend
bunx convex deploy --prod
```

📖 **Important**: For first-time deployment setup, see the **[Cloudflare Pages Setup Guide](./docs/technical-guides/cloudflare-pages-setup.md)** for detailed configuration instructions.
