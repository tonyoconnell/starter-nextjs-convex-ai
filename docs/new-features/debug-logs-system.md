# Debug Logs System (Story 3.6 + Dashboard Improvements)

**Epic**: [Epic 3: Resilient Real-time Logging](../template-development/prd/epic-3.md)

## New Features Added

### Dashboard Layout Architecture

- **Collapsible sidebar** (420px width) for controls and settings
- **Main content area** optimized for data visualization
- **Responsive design** with toggle functionality
- **Clean separation** between data management and data viewing

### Redis Data Sync Interface

- View Redis buffer statistics without importing data
- Display log count, active traces, users, and system breakdown
- Show Redis connection status and TTL information
- **Volume-aware warnings** with time estimates for large syncs
- **Compact sidebar format** for space efficiency

### Advanced Data Synchronization

- **"Sync All" button** with smart volume warnings and progress tracking
- **"Sync by Trace"** input for specific trace_id logs with validation
- **"Sync by User"** input for specific user_id logs with advanced filtering
- **"Clear Redis + Auto-Sync"** for fresh debugging sessions
- **Collapsible advanced options** to reduce UI clutter
- **Real-time progress indicators** with detailed status messages
- **Button repositioning** underneath descriptions for better UX
- **Redis stats refresh integration** - all sync operations automatically trigger Redis buffer state refresh for UI consistency

### Smart Log Categorization & Authentication Integration

- **System detection** automatically categorizes logs as `browser` vs `convex`
- **Preserves all logs** while providing intelligent filtering
- **Smart categorization patterns** for Convex backend operations
- **Real-time user authentication** - LoggingProvider connected to AuthProvider via useAuth() hook
- **Authenticated user tracking** - console logs display actual user email instead of 'anonymous'
- **Live user ID updates** - automatically updates when authentication state changes

### Enhanced Data Visualization

- **Reverse chronological sorting** with toggle to chronological view
- **Advanced filtering**: system, level, trace ID, user ID, and full-text search
- **"App Only" quick filter** for browser logs excluding system logs
- **Expandable rows** for detailed log context and stack traces
- **Badge-based categorization** with color coding for log levels and systems
- **Real-time refresh** with manual refresh triggers

### Revolutionary Export System

- **Target selection first**: Tabs interface for Clipboard (default) or Download - clearer than radio buttons
- **Single action button** with dynamic labels that handles data fetching and export
- **Smart button states**: Shows progress ("Copying..." / "Preparing Download...") and success
- **Full-width layout** underneath logs table for better configuration space
- **Export formats**: JSON (structured), CSV (spreadsheet), Readable Text (human-friendly)
- **Advanced filtering**: Format, trace/user filters, limits, and chronological sorting
- **Live preview** with truncation for large datasets
- **Contextual success messages** for clipboard vs download operations

### Enhanced Console Override System

- **Read-only suppression panel** showing hardcoded patterns from source code
- **Pattern categorization** (Development, React, Browser, Custom, Convex Sync) with badges
- **Message testing tool** to check if logs would be suppressed
- **Educational interface** explaining how suppression works
- **No accidental pattern modification** - patterns remain in source control
- **Expanded suppression patterns** for Convex administrative operations:
  - Sync operation logs (`syncAllLogs`, `clearRedisAndSync`, `clearRedisLogs`)
  - Data organization messages (`Clearing existing debug logs`, `Synced X logs from Redis`)
  - Administrative status updates (`Failed to insert log`, `logs for trace`)
  - **Claude logging system meta-logs** (`Claude logging provider initialized`, `Claude logging user context updated`)
  - **Self-referential noise prevention** - sync operations don't pollute their own data

### Git Ignore Improvements

- **PNG file protection** in root directories to prevent screenshot commits
- **Strategic ignoring** allows assets in deeper directories while blocking temp files
- **Multi-directory coverage** for all app roots
