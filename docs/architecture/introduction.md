# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for The Agentic Starter Template, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this modern fullstack application where these concerns are deeply intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on our Project Brief, this project is being built from scratch to **create** a new starter template. Therefore, no existing starter template is being used as a foundation. All tooling, configuration, and architectural patterns will be established and documented herein.
