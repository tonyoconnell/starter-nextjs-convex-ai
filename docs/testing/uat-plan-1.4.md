### ‚úÖ **AC3: Simple Test Query Connection**

**Acceptance Criteria:** A simple test query is created in Convex and called from the homepage to confirm the connection.

#### Test Steps:

1. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Action:** Locate the "üì° Convex Connection Test" panel on the homepage
3. **Verify:** Connection status and real-time data display

#### Expected Results:

- [ ] Connection Test panel shows "‚úÖ Connected!" status
- [ ] Test message displays correctly from Convex backend
- [ ] Status field shows "active" or similar success indicator
- [ ] Messages count displays number from database (0 or more)
- [ ] Loading states work properly (shows "Loading..." initially)

#### Pass/Fail Criteria:

- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Test query successfully connects, retrieves data, and displays results
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Connection fails, shows error messages, or displays "Connection failed"

### ‚úÖ **AC4: Real-time Data Validation**

**Acceptance Criteria:** Real-time connection works properly with live data updates.

#### Test Steps:

1. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Action:** Keep the page open and observe the Convex Connection Test panel
3. **Verify:** Data updates automatically if backend changes occur

#### Expected Results:

- [ ] Initial data loads within 2-3 seconds
- [ ] No manual refresh required to see data
- [ ] Connection remains stable during page interaction
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully if connection issues occur

#### Pass/Fail Criteria:

- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Real-time subscription works, data loads automatically, connection is stable
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Data doesn't load, requires manual refresh, or connection is unstable

## Browser Compatibility Testing

Test the implemented functionality in:
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox  
- [ ] Safari (if on macOS)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (responsive design)

## Responsive Design Testing

Test responsive behavior:
- [ ] Desktop view (1920x1080)
- [ ] Tablet view (768x1024)
- [ ] Mobile view (375x667)
- [ ] Text remains readable at all sizes
- [ ] Layout doesn't break at different screen sizes
- [ ] Convex Connection Test panel is visible on all screen sizes

## UAT Completion Checklist

## Next Steps After UAT

1. **If UAT PASSES:** Story 1.4 is ready for the next story in the Epic 1 sequence
2. **If UAT FAILS:** Document issues and return to development for fixes
3. **Documentation:** Update any learnings or issues found during UAT
4. **Knowledge Capture:** Record any patterns or insights for future Convex integration reference

## UAT Execution Notes

### Key Testing Focus Areas:

1. **Visual Validation**: Ensure the Convex Connection Test panel appears and functions correctly
2. **Real-time Functionality**: Verify that data loads automatically without manual refresh
3. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when Convex backend is unavailable
4. **Performance**: Ensure connection establishment is fast and stable
5. **Integration**: Verify no regression in existing Next.js functionality

### Troubleshooting Guide:

**If Connection Test Shows "Loading..." Indefinitely:**
- Check that `npx convex dev` is running in apps/convex directory
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check browser console for authentication errors

**If Connection Test Shows "Connection failed":**
- Verify Convex backend is properly deployed
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure Convex URL is correct in environment variables

**If Console Shows Import Errors:**
- Verify Convex types are generated (`_generated` folder exists)
- Check that both dev servers are running
- Restart development servers if needed
