# Test Metrics Tracking

This document tracks test metrics over time to monitor testing progress, regressions, and improvements across the codebase.

## Purpose

- **Progress Monitoring**: Track whether we're moving ahead or regressing
- **Baseline Awareness**: Know where we started to measure improvement
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain visibility into test suite health
- **CI/CD Health**: Monitor continuous integration stability

## Current Metrics

### Latest Results (2025-07-26)

**Test Suites:**
- ✅ Passed: 34
- ❌ Failed: 2  
- **Total: 36**

**Individual Tests:**
- ✅ Passed: 329
- ❌ Failed: 15
- ⏸️ Skipped: 24
- **Total: 368**

**Success Rate:**
- Test Suites: 94.4% (34/36)
- Individual Tests: 89.4% (329/368)

### Historical Tracking

| Date | Test Suites (Pass/Fail/Total) | Tests (Pass/Fail/Skip/Total) | CI Status | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-07-26 | 34/2/36 | 329/15/24/368 | ✅ PASSING | Baseline after Story 4.2 completion + TS fixes |

## Breakdown by Area

### Test Suite Categories

*To be updated with specific test suite breakdown*

### Known Issues

*Document current failing tests and reasons*

## Improvement Targets

### Short Term Goals
- [ ] Achieve 95%+ test suite success rate
- [ ] Reduce failed individual tests to <10
- [ ] Investigate and fix skipped tests

### Long Term Goals  
- [ ] Achieve 98%+ test suite success rate
- [ ] Maintain <5 failed individual tests
- [ ] Comprehensive coverage for all critical paths

## Monitoring Process

### Update Frequency
- **Weekly**: Update metrics during sprint reviews
- **After Major Features**: Update after story completion
- **CI Failures**: Document significant regressions

### Metric Collection
```bash
# Run full test suite and capture metrics
bun test 2>&1 | tee test-results.log

# Extract summary metrics
grep -E "(Test Suites|Tests):" test-results.log
```

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Critical**: >5 failed test suites
- **Warning**: <90% individual test success rate
- **Investigation Needed**: >30 skipped tests
