# Test Metrics Tracking

This document tracks test metrics over time to monitor testing progress, regressions, and improvements across the codebase.

## Purpose

- **Progress Monitoring**: Track whether we're moving ahead or regressing
- **Baseline Awareness**: Know where we started to measure improvement
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain visibility into test suite health
- **CI/CD Health**: Monitor continuous integration stability

## Current Metrics

### Latest Results (2025-07-26 - Post Script Standardization)

**Aggregated Across Both Apps:**

- ‚úÖ Test Suites Passed: 4/8 (50% success rate)
- ‚ùå Individual Tests Failed: 235/513 (54.2% success rate)

**By Application:**

**Web App (Frontend):**

- Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 failed (50%)
- Individual Tests: 1 passed, 196 failed (0.5%)
- Coverage: 72.57% statements, 70.08% branches
- Status: ‚ùå FAILING (Convex hook mocking issues)

**Convex App (Backend):**

- Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 failed (50%)
- Individual Tests: 277 passed, 39 failed (87.7%)
- Coverage: 25.5% statements, 27.54% branches
- Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PASSING_WITH_FAILURES (text processing edge cases)

## Breakdown by Area

### Test Suite Categories

_To be updated with specific test suite breakdown_

### Known Issues

_Document current failing tests and reasons_

## Improvement Targets

### Short Term Goals

- [ ] Achieve 95%+ test suite success rate
- [ ] Reduce failed individual tests to <10
- [ ] Investigate and fix skipped tests

### Long Term Goals

- [ ] Achieve 98%+ test suite success rate
- [ ] Maintain <5 failed individual tests
- [ ] Comprehensive coverage for all critical paths

## Monitoring Process

### Update Frequency

- **Weekly**: Update metrics during sprint reviews
- **After Major Features**: Update after story completion
- **CI Failures**: Document significant regressions

### Metric Collection

```bash
# Run full test suite and capture metrics
bun test 2>&1 | tee test-results.log

# Extract summary metrics
grep -E "(Test Suites|Tests):" test-results.log
```

### Alerting Thresholds

- **Critical**: >5 failed test suites
- **Warning**: <90% individual test success rate
- **Investigation Needed**: >30 skipped tests
