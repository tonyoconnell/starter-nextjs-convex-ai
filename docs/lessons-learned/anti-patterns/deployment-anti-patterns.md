# Deployment Anti-Patterns

## Overview

This document captures anti-patterns identified during Cloudflare Pages deployment (Story 1.3) and other deployment experiences. These patterns should be avoided to prevent deployment failures and configuration issues.

## Critical Anti-Patterns

### Using wrangler.toml for Cloudflare Pages Projects

**Anti-Pattern**: Creating and using `wrangler.toml` configuration for Cloudflare Pages deployments

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

```toml
# ❌ DON'T: This conflicts with Cloudflare Pages configuration
name = "my-app"
compatibility_date = "2024-11-04"
pages_build_output_dir = ".vercel/output/static"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
```

**Why This is Wrong**:

- wrangler.toml is designed for Cloudflare Workers, not Pages
- Creates configuration conflicts with Cloudflare Pages automatic settings
- Overrides dashboard configuration in unexpected ways
- Causes deployment failures and confusing error messages

**Correct Approach**:

- Configure everything through Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Use environment variables for dynamic configuration
- Keep wrangler.toml only for Workers projects

**Impact**: Configuration conflicts, deployment failures, debugging confusion

### Running Development Scripts in CI Environment

**Anti-Pattern**: Allowing development-only scripts to execute in CI/CD pipelines

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Husky tries to install git hooks in read-only CI environment
- Development tools assume interactive environment
- Causes CI build failures
- Wastes CI resources and time

**Correct Approach**:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "echo 'Skipping husky in CI' && exit 0"
  }
}
```

**Alternative Solutions**:

- Use environment variables: `HUSKY=0`
- Conditional execution: `if [ "$CI" != "true" ]; then husky install; fi`

**Impact**: CI build failures, blocked deployments, wasted development time

### Ignoring Node.js Compatibility Requirements

**Anti-Pattern**: Not enabling required compatibility flags for Node.js runtime features

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Deploying Next.js app without `nodejs_compat` flag
- Assuming Cloudflare Workers includes all Node.js features
- Ignoring runtime compatibility errors

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Cloudflare Workers runtime is not identical to Node.js
- Missing compatibility flags cause runtime errors
- App fails in production despite working locally

**Correct Approach**:

- Always enable `nodejs_compat` for Next.js applications
- Test compatibility flags in preview environment
- Monitor runtime errors and adjust flags as needed

**Impact**: Runtime failures, user-facing errors, application crashes

### Using Incorrect Output Directories

**Anti-Pattern**: Using wrong build output directories for Cloudflare Pages

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

```
Output Directory: dist
Output Directory: .next
Output Directory: build
```

**Why This is Wrong**:

- @cloudflare/next-on-pages creates specific output structure
- Wrong directory contains incorrect or missing files
- Deployment succeeds but app doesn't work correctly

**Correct Approach**:

- Always use `.vercel/output/static` for @cloudflare/next-on-pages
- Verify build process creates expected directory structure
- Test local build output before deployment

**Impact**: Broken deployments, missing assets, non-functional applications

### Mixed Deployment Strategy Configuration

**Anti-Pattern**: Attempting to use both manual and auto-deployment simultaneously

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Configuring Git integration AND using manual Wrangler deployments
- Having conflicting deployment configurations
- Using different build processes for different deployment methods

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Creates confusion about which deployment is active
- Can lead to inconsistent application state
- Makes rollback and debugging difficult

**Correct Approach**:

- Choose primary deployment method (recommend auto-deployment)
- Use manual deployment only for testing and development
- Keep deployment processes consistent

**Impact**: Deployment confusion, inconsistent state, difficult rollbacks

## Configuration Anti-Patterns

### Hardcoding Environment-Specific Values

**Anti-Pattern**: Including environment-specific configuration in committed files

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

```javascript
// ❌ DON'T: Hardcoded values in configuration
const nextConfig = {
  env: {
    API_URL: 'https://my-production-api.com',
    ENVIRONMENT: 'production',
  },
};
```

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Prevents environment-specific configuration
- Requires code changes for different environments
- Increases risk of wrong configuration

**Correct Approach**:

```javascript
// ✅ DO: Use environment variables
const nextConfig = {
  env: {
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
    ENVIRONMENT: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  },
};
```

**Impact**: Configuration inflexibility, deployment errors, security risks

### Assuming Default Configurations Work

**Anti-Pattern**: Not explicitly configuring required settings

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Assuming default Next.js configuration works with Cloudflare Pages
- Not setting required flags like `output: 'export'`
- Skipping image optimization configuration

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Default configurations often don't match deployment requirements
- Leads to runtime errors and broken functionality
- Wastes time debugging implicit assumptions

**Correct Approach**:

- Explicitly configure all required settings
- Document configuration decisions and rationale
- Test configuration in environment similar to production

**Impact**: Runtime errors, broken functionality, debugging overhead

### Copying Configuration Without Understanding

**Anti-Pattern**: Copy-pasting configuration from other projects without adaptation

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Using Vercel-specific configuration for Cloudflare Pages
- Copying Workers configuration for Pages projects
- Using outdated configuration examples

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Different platforms have different requirements
- Configuration may be outdated or incorrect
- Leads to subtle bugs and incompatibilities

**Correct Approach**:

- Understand configuration requirements for specific platform
- Adapt configuration to current project needs
- Validate configuration works with current versions

**Impact**: Subtle bugs, performance issues, compatibility problems

## Build Process Anti-Patterns

### Skipping Build Process Steps

**Anti-Pattern**: Not running complete build process before deployment

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

```bash
# ❌ DON'T: Skip necessary build steps
next build
# Missing: npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Incomplete build process produces incorrect output
- Missing platform-specific optimizations
- Deployment appears successful but app doesn't work

**Correct Approach**:

```bash
# ✅ DO: Complete build process
next build
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

**Impact**: Broken deployments, missing functionality, wasted debugging time

### Ignoring Build Warnings and Errors

**Anti-Pattern**: Deploying despite build warnings or non-fatal errors

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Ignoring TypeScript warnings
- Deploying with ESLint errors
- Skipping test failures

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Warnings often indicate real problems
- Issues compound over time
- Harder to debug problems in production

**Correct Approach**:

- Fix all build warnings before deployment
- Treat warnings as potential errors
- Use strict build configuration

**Impact**: Runtime errors, poor code quality, difficult maintenance

### Not Testing Build Output Locally

**Anti-Pattern**: Deploying without testing build output locally

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Running `bun run build` and immediately deploying
- Not testing with `wrangler pages dev`
- Assuming CI build will work if local dev works

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Build output may be different from development version
- Platform-specific issues only appear with proper build
- Wastes deployment cycles and CI resources

**Correct Approach**:

```bash
# ✅ DO: Test build output locally
bun run build:pages
npx wrangler pages dev .vercel/output/static
# Test functionality before deploying
```

**Impact**: Failed deployments, wasted CI resources, slower development cycle

## Environment Management Anti-Patterns

### Not Setting CI Environment Variables

**Anti-Pattern**: Forgetting to configure environment variables for CI environment

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Not setting `HUSKY=0` in CI
- Missing platform-specific environment variables
- Not configuring different values for preview vs production

**Why This is Wrong**:

- CI builds fail unexpectedly
- Different behavior between environments
- Security issues with missing or wrong configuration

**Correct Approach**:

- Configure all required environment variables
- Use different values for different environments
- Document required environment variables

**Impact**: CI failures, environment inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities

### Exposing Sensitive Information

**Anti-Pattern**: Including sensitive information in client-side configuration

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

```javascript
// ❌ DON'T: Expose sensitive values
const config = {
  apiKey: 'secret-api-key-12345',
  databaseUrl: 'postgres://user:pass@host/db',
};
```

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Client-side code is visible to users
- Sensitive information can be extracted
- Security vulnerability

**Correct Approach**:

- Use server-side environment variables for sensitive data
- Prefix client variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only when needed
- Use secure credential management

**Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, data breaches, compliance issues

## Troubleshooting Anti-Patterns

### Making Multiple Changes Simultaneously

**Anti-Pattern**: Changing multiple configuration items when troubleshooting

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Changing build command, output directory, and environment variables at once
- Updating dependencies while changing configuration
- Modifying multiple files without testing each change

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Impossible to identify which change fixed the issue
- May introduce new problems while fixing others
- Makes it harder to understand root cause

**Correct Approach**:

- Change one thing at a time
- Test each change before making the next
- Document what was changed and why

**Impact**: Unclear fixes, new problems, difficult root cause analysis

### Not Reading Error Messages Carefully

**Anti-Pattern**: Making assumptions about error causes without reading full error messages

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Seeing "build failed" and assuming it's a code issue
- Not reading full stack traces
- Jumping to solutions without understanding the problem

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Miss important details in error messages
- Fix wrong problems
- Waste time on incorrect solutions

**Correct Approach**:

- Read complete error messages and logs
- Understand error context and stack traces
- Research specific error messages

**Impact**: Wasted time, incorrect fixes, recurring problems

### Not Documenting Solutions

**Anti-Pattern**: Fixing issues without documenting the solution

**Example of What NOT to Do**:

- Solving deployment issues and moving on
- Not sharing solution with team
- Not updating documentation with new knowledge

**Why This is Wrong**:

- Same issues will recur
- Team doesn't benefit from knowledge
- Wastes time re-solving same problems

**Correct Approach**:

- Document issue and solution
- Update troubleshooting guides
- Share knowledge with team

**Impact**: Repeated problems, knowledge loss, inefficient team
