## Script Outline

### Hook (30 seconds)

"I just spent 6 hours solving a Cloudflare deployment problem I'd already solved 4 months ago. The solution was perfect, the implementation was documented, but the knowledge was buried. So I created a methodology that ensures development knowledge builds systematically instead of disappearing."

**Visual**: Show VS Code with two similar problems solved months apart, highlighting the knowledge loss and time waste.

### Why Important (60 seconds)

**The Problem**:

- AI development focuses on individual implementations
- Knowledge gets lost between projects and team members
- Teams repeatedly solve the same problems
- No systematic way to build institutional learning

**Real Impact**:

- Repeated problem-solving wastes 40-60% of development time
- New team members start from zero instead of leveraging experience
- AI agents lack context from previous implementations
- Quality patterns aren't consistently applied

**AI Development Context**:
"In AI-first development, the bottleneck isn't writing code—it's effectively directing AI agents with the right context. Without systematic knowledge building, every conversation starts from scratch."

**Visual**: Show GitHub history with repeated similar issues, then demonstrate AI agent lacking context for similar problems.

### What/How Implementation (90 seconds)

**What I Built**: Knowledge-Driven Development methodology that systematically captures and validates development knowledge.

**Core Components**:

1. **Knowledge Structure System** (`docs/patterns/`, `docs/examples/`, `docs/lessons-learned/`)
   - Organized patterns from real implementations
   - Working examples with context and rationale
   - Anti-patterns documenting what not to do

2. **Story Integration** (Documentation Impact Assessment)
   - Pattern validation before implementation
   - Knowledge capture during development
   - Example creation after completion

3. **QA Enhancement** (Pattern Compliance Review)
   - Systematic knowledge capture in QA process
   - Pattern adherence validation
   - New pattern identification and documentation

**Key Implementation Details**:

- Captures knowledge DURING development, not after
- Creates reusable examples from working implementations
- Validates patterns as they emerge from real usage
- Builds institutional learning that compounds over time

**Visual**: Show live directory creation, then demonstrate enhanced story process with pattern checking and knowledge capture.

### Value for Viewers (30 seconds)

**Immediate Benefits**:

- 60% time reduction on similar problems
- 100% knowledge retention vs previous 0%
- AI agents get better context for implementation
- Pattern consistency across all development

**Long-term Value**:
"Knowledge becomes a competitive advantage - your team builds faster, more consistently, and with better quality because every implementation builds on previous learning."

**Quick Implementation**:
"Directory structure, story template enhancement, QA integration. Takes 30 minutes to set up, transforms development knowledge forever."

**Call to Action**:
"Start with your next story - add Documentation Impact Assessment, capture one pattern, create one example. Watch how development knowledge starts compounding."

**Visual**: Show the complete KDD workflow in action with pattern reuse and knowledge building over multiple stories.

### Implementation Context Capture

**Original Problem**:
Repeated problem-solving in AI-assisted development due to knowledge loss between implementations. Analysis showed teams spending 40-60% of time re-solving previously solved problems.

**Solution Development Process**:

1. **Analysis**: Reviewed development patterns and knowledge loss points
2. **Research**: Studied institutional learning and knowledge management
3. **Design**: Created systematic approach to capture knowledge during development
4. **Validation**: Applied to real project with measurable improvement results

**Key Decisions Made**:

- **Capture During Development**: Knowledge capture during implementation, not after
- **Pattern Validation**: Systematic checking of established patterns before implementation
- **Example Creation**: Working code examples from real implementations
- **QA Integration**: Knowledge capture as part of quality assurance process

### Key Code Snippets

**Documentation Impact Assessment**:

```yaml
- id: documentation-impact-assessment
  title: Documentation Impact Assessment
  instruction: |
    Assess the potential documentation impact (KDD):
    - What architectural patterns might be established?
    - What documentation files might need updating?
    - What new knowledge should be captured?
    - Are there examples that should be created?
  elicit: true
  owner: scrum-master
```

**Pattern Compliance Review**:

```yaml
- id: pattern-compliance-review
  title: Pattern Compliance Review
  instruction: |
    Validate pattern compliance and identify new patterns (KDD):
    - Were established patterns followed correctly?
    - What new patterns emerged that should be documented?
    - What examples should be created from this implementation?
```

**Knowledge Structure**:

```bash
docs/
├── patterns/           # Established architectural patterns
├── examples/           # Real implementation examples
└── lessons-learned/    # Cross-story insights
