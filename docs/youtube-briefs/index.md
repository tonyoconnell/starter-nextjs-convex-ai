- **Benefits**: 90% capacity accuracy improvement, data-driven sprint planning
- **Implementation**: Template modifications, estimation guidelines, agent integration
- **Status**: Fully implemented with working template enhancements

## Knowledge-Driven Development (KDD)

### [KDD Methodology](./kdd-methodology-brief.md)

YouTube brief for Knowledge-Driven Development methodology demonstration:

- **Duration**: 3-4 minutes
- **Focus**: Systematic knowledge building in AI-assisted development
- **Benefits**: 60% time reduction on similar problems, 100% knowledge retention
- **Implementation**: Knowledge structure system, story integration, pattern validation
- **Context**: Methodology for preventing knowledge loss in development

## Brief Creation Guidelines

### Structure Requirements

All YouTube briefs follow the validated methodology:

1. **Video Overview** - Duration, target, context (macro/micro)
2. **Visual Narrative** - 8-slide Gamma.AI optimized structure
3. **Script Outline** - Hook (30s) / Why Important (60s) / What/How (90s) / Value (30s)
4. **Technical Implementation Details** - Files modified/created, commit references
5. **Production Elements** - Screen recordings, visual graphics, code demonstrations

### Content Standards

- **Commit Integration**: Include specific commit hashes and GitHub compare links
- **Implementation Context**: Capture how/why decisions were made
- **Inline Diffs**: Show before/after code changes for visual demonstrations
- **Value Proposition**: Case-specific benefits with quantifiable improvements
- **Production Ready**: Clear screen recording specs and visual element descriptions

### File References

Each brief includes comprehensive technical details:

- **Files Modified**: Complete paths and descriptions of changes
- **Commit References**: Hashes, GitHub compare URLs, implementation context
- **Code Snippets**: Key implementation examples with syntax highlighting
- **Inline Diffs**: Before/after comparisons for visual demonstration

## Contributing YouTube Briefs

When creating new YouTube briefs:

1. **Follow Methodology** - Use [YouTube Brief Methodology](../methodology/youtube-brief-methodology.md)
2. **Include Implementation Context** - Capture how and why from same conversation when possible
3. **Add Commit References** - Include hashes, compare links, and inline diffs
4. **Optimize for Gamma.AI** - 8-slide hierarchical structure with clear content blocks
5. **Update This Index** - Add new brief descriptions with focus and benefits
