## Script Outline

### Hook (30 seconds)

"What if your AI coding assistant had specialized expertise in testing infrastructure? Today I'm showing you how to create domain-specific agents in the BMAD ecosystem that go beyond generic development help."

**Screen Recording**: Show the test-dev.md agent file structure

### Why Important (90 seconds)

"We learned from our recent testing infrastructure work that achieving high test coverage requires specific knowledge - understanding Jest vs Bun limitations, complex mocking patterns, and systematic coverage improvement strategies. A generic development agent doesn't have this specialized expertise built in.

The BMAD agent system lets us create specialized personas with domain-specific knowledge, commands, and workflows. Instead of explaining mocking strategies every time, we can embed that expertise directly into an agent."

**Screen Recording**:

- Show coverage improvement results (60% â†’ 86.7%)
- Demonstrate complex mocking patterns from auth tests
- Show the generic dev agent vs specialized needs

### What/How Implementation (120 seconds)

"Creating a specialized agent involves three key components:

First, the persona definition - we're creating 'TestBot', a test engineer focused on coverage optimization and systematic testing approaches.

Second, specialized commands - instead of generic 'help' commands, we have `*coverage-analysis` for gap identification, `*create-test-suite` for comprehensive testing, and `*mock-strategy` for complex dependency handling.

Third, integrated knowledge - the agent automatically references our testing strategy documentation, patterns, and lessons learned from infrastructure work."

**Screen Recording**:

- Walk through the test-dev.md file structure
- Show the YAML configuration sections
- Highlight the command definitions
- Show integration with testing documentation files

### Value for Viewers (30 seconds)

"This pattern gives you AI assistance with deep domain expertise. The agent knows to use `npx jest` instead of `bun test`, understands singleton testing patterns, and can systematically improve coverage. Plus, this template shows how to create other specialized agents for your specific domains."

**Screen Recording**: Show the agent greeting and command interface

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**Primary Implementation:**

- `/Users/davidcruwys/dev/ad/appydave/appydave-templates/starter-nextjs-convex-ai/.bmad-core/agents/test-dev.md`

**Referenced Documentation:**

- `docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`
- `docs/patterns/testing-patterns.md`
- `docs/lessons-learned/technology/testing-infrastructure-kdd.md`
- `docs/methodology/youtube-brief-methodology.md`

### Implementation Context

**Design Rationale:**
This agent was created based on lessons learned from implementing comprehensive testing infrastructure, where we discovered that achieving high coverage (86.7% statements, 79.49% branches) requires specific expertise in:

- Jest vs Bun test runner compatibility
- Complex mocking strategies for Convex and auth services
- Systematic error path testing
- Coverage-driven development approaches

**Agent Architecture Decisions:**

- **Persona-driven**: TestBot identity with systematic, coverage-focused approach
- **Command specialization**: Testing-specific commands rather than generic development commands
- **Knowledge integration**: Direct references to established testing documentation
- **Workflow enforcement**: Built-in adherence to testing standards and patterns

**BMAD Integration Pattern:**

- Follows established `.bmad-core/agents/` directory structure
- Uses same YAML configuration pattern as existing dev agent
- Integrates with task/template/checklist dependency system
- Maintains compatibility with BMAD activation and command protocols

### Key Design Decisions

**Specialization Focus:**

- Coverage optimization and gap analysis expertise
- Strategic test planning and implementation guidance
- Mocking strategy design for complex dependencies
- Error path testing and edge case identification

**Command Design:**

- `*coverage-analysis`: Strategic coverage improvement planning
- `*gap-analysis`: Deep dive into specific coverage gaps
- `*create-test-suite`: Comprehensive test generation
- `*mock-strategy`: Complex dependency mocking design
- `*coverage-sprint`: Focused coverage improvement execution

**Knowledge Embedding:**

- Testing standards and patterns automatically referenced
- Lessons learned from infrastructure work included
- Best practices enforced through agent behavior
- Proven patterns and anti-patterns built into guidance
