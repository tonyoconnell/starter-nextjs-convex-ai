# Starter NextJS Convex AI - Documentation

## Overview

This is a Next.js template for building AI-first applications using the BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development) methodology. It combines modern web development practices with structured AI-assisted development workflows.

## Key Features

- **AI-First Architecture** - Built from the ground up for AI agent collaboration
- **BMAD Methodology** - Structured approach to AI-assisted development
- **Modern Stack** - Next.js, Convex, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Developer Experience** - Chrome DevTools to Claude Code integration
- **Cost-Effective** - Optimized for <$10/month at small scale

## Quick Links

- **[Getting Started](../README.md)** - Setup and installation
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Claude Code specific instructions
- **[BMAD Method](./methodology/bmad-context-engineering.md)** - Development methodology

## Getting Started with Development

1. **Review Core Documents**
   - Read [Project Brief](./project-brief.md) for context
   - Study [PRD](./prd.md) for requirements
   - Understand [Architecture](./architecture.md) decisions

2. **Understand the Methodology**
   - Read [BMAD Context Engineering](./methodology/bmad-context-engineering.md)
   - Review the [Agentic Persona](./methodology/agentic-architect-developer-persona.md)

3. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Follow the [Dev Error Pipeline](./technical-guides/dev-error-pipeline.md) setup
   - Configure Chrome DevTools integration

4. **Start Building**
   - Use BMAD agents for planning
   - Implement with Claude Code
   - Test with integrated tooling

## Key Innovations

### 1. Chrome DevTools to Claude Code Bridge
Seamless integration between browser debugging and AI assistance:
- Zero-friction console log capture
- Automatic context preservation
- E2E test integration

### 2. Cost-Conscious Architecture
Built to scale efficiently:
- Hybrid logging pattern
- Smart error sampling
- Convex-first data strategy

### 3. AI-Native Development Flow
Every aspect optimized for AI collaboration:
- Context-rich story files
- Specialized agent personas
- Continuous feedback loops
