# Story 2.3: Build the Component Showcase Page

## Status

✅ **READY**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to view a page that showcases all available UI components,
**so that** I can understand the visual language and capabilities of the starter template.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new page is created at `/showcase` in the Next.js application.
2. This page imports and displays an instance of every component from the `packages/ui` library.
3. The page is linked in the main navigation.
4. The page layout is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.

## Documentation Impact Assessment

This story establishes a key user-facing feature that demonstrates the template's capabilities:

- **Component Documentation**: Creates a living showcase of all available UI components
- **User Experience**: Provides users with a visual reference for the template's design system
- **Development Reference**: Helps developers understand component usage patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Visual validation that all components render correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 completion, we have established:

- Storybook environment configured in `packages/storybook/` [Source: story 2.2]
- Comprehensive Button component story with all variants documented [Source: story 2.2]
- Working integration between UI package and development tools [Source: story 2.2]
- Unit testing framework established for UI component validation [Source: story 2.2]

From Story 2.1 completion, we have:

- ShadCN/UI components integrated: Button, Card, and Input components [Source: story 2.1]
- Shared UI package structure with proper TypeScript configuration [Source: story 2.1]
- Working component imports and exports through `packages/ui/index.ts` [Source: story 2.1]

### Technical Context

**Data Models**: No specific data models required for this static showcase page. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**API Specifications**: No API endpoints required for this story.

**Component Specifications**: [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js version: 14.2.x specified in tech stack for frontend application
- Components available from packages/ui: Button, Card, Input [Source: story 2.1 completion]
- Button variants: default, secondary, destructive, outline, ghost, link [Source: story 2.2 documentation]
- Tailwind CSS integration for styling [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- ShadCN/UI library integration for accessible, themeable components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**File Locations**: Based on project structure guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- Next.js application: `apps/web/` (main web application)
- New showcase page: `apps/web/app/showcase/page.tsx` (Next.js app router structure)
- UI components source: `packages/ui/src/` (shared component library)
- Main navigation: Location to be determined in app structure
- Component imports: `packages/ui/index.ts` (established export structure)

**Testing Requirements**: Following test strategy standards [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

- Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test file locations: `apps/web/__tests__/` or co-located test files
- Coverage targets: 85%+ statements, 80%+ branches for new pages
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting (not `bun test`)
- Test component rendering and responsive behavior

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing tests, review the comprehensive test knowledge base developed during Epic 1, including testing patterns, utilities, and best practices documented across the knowledge base files. This will ensure consistency with established testing approaches and leverage proven patterns.

**Technical Constraints**:

- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- No use of `any` type allowed [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- Follow established file naming conventions [Source: CLAUDE.md#important-conventions]
- Next.js version must match tech stack specification (14.2.x) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Notes

Based on architecture guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- ✅ `apps/web/` directory is defined as the Next.js frontend application
- ✅ App router structure supports page creation at `app/showcase/page.tsx`
- ✅ UI components are available from `packages/ui/` shared library
- ✅ Aligns with established monorepo pattern

**No structural conflicts identified** - the story requirements align perfectly with the defined architecture.

### Pattern Validation

**Architectural Patterns**: No specific patterns found in docs/patterns/ directory for this story implementation.

**Component Integration**: Must follow established ShadCN/UI integration patterns from Story 2.1 implementation.

**Layout Patterns**: Should follow Next.js app router conventions and responsive design patterns.

### Testing

**Test Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Use Jest with React Testing Library for component and page testing
- Create tests for showcase page rendering and component display
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting
- Coverage targets: 85% statements, 80% branches for apps/web
- Test responsive behavior and navigation integration

**Test File Locations**: `apps/web/__tests__/` or co-located with page components

**Testing Frameworks**:

- Jest for test runner and assertions [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- React Testing Library for component and page testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Next.js testing utilities for app router page testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Page renders without errors
- All UI components display correctly on the page
- Responsive layout works across screen sizes
- Navigation integration functions properly
- Component sections are properly organized and accessible
