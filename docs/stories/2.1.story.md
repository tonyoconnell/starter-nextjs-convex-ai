# Story 2.1: Integrate ShadCN/UI Library

## Status

Ready

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the ShadCN/UI library fully integrated into the Next.js application,
**so that** I have a set of accessible, themeable components to build with.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The ShadCN/UI CLI is used to initialize the library in the `apps/web` project.
2. Core dependencies like Tailwind CSS and Radix UI are correctly configured.
3. A handful of basic components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`) are added to the `packages/ui` directory.
4. The components can be successfully imported and rendered on the homepage.

## Documentation Impact Assessment

This story establishes fundamental UI component patterns that will be referenced throughout the project:

- **Architectural Patterns**: Validates the shared UI package approach and ShadCN/UI integration
- **Documentation Updates**: May require updates to component usage examples and integration guides
- **Knowledge Capture**: Component integration patterns, ShadCN CLI usage, and monorepo UI package setup
- **Examples**: Basic component usage examples that can serve as templates for future components

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Epic 1 completion, we have established:

- Monorepo structure with `apps/` and `packages/` directories [Source: story 1.1]
- Bun package manager and Turborepo build system [Source: story 1.1]
- TypeScript and ESLint configuration standards [Source: story 1.1]

### Pattern Validation

Component development must follow established patterns:

- Server-First Components: Default approach for Next.js App Router [Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md#server-first-components]
- Tailwind-First Approach: Use Tailwind utility classes as primary styling method [Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md#tailwind-first-approach]
- ShadCN Component Integration: Use ShadCN components as base building blocks [Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md#shadcn-component-integration]

### Technical Context

**Data Models**: No specific data models required for basic component integration.

**API Specifications**: No API endpoints required for this story.

**Component Specifications**:

- Button component: Interactive component requiring `"use client"` for event handlers [Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md#client-component-boundaries]
- Card component: Can be Server Component for static display cases
- Input component: Interactive form component requiring client-side state management
- All components must follow Tailwind-first styling and ShadCN theming patterns [Source: docs/patterns/frontend-patterns.md#styling-patterns]

**File Locations**: Based on project structure guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- ShadCN initialization: `apps/web/` (Next.js frontend application)
- Shared components: `packages/ui/` (shared, reusable UI component library)
- Component exports: `packages/ui/index.ts`
- Homepage integration: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`

**Testing Requirements**: Following test strategy standards [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

- Unit tests for all components with Jest and React Testing Library
- Test file locations: `packages/ui/__tests__/` or co-located `*.test.tsx` files
- Custom render with providers pattern for testing components with context
- Coverage targets: 85%+ statements, 80%+ branches for UI package

**Technical Constraints**:

- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- No use of `any` type allowed [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- Follow established file naming conventions: Components use PascalCase [Source: CLAUDE.md#important-conventions]

### Testing

**Test Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Use Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Create custom render function with providers for context-dependent components
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting (not `bun test`)
- Test user interactions with `@testing-library/user-event`
- Coverage targets: 85% statements, 80% branches for shared packages

**Test File Locations**: `packages/ui/__tests__/` or co-located with components

**Testing Frameworks**:

- Jest for test runner and assertions
- React Testing Library for component testing
- @testing-library/user-event for interaction testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Button: Test click handlers, disabled state, variant styling
- Card: Test content rendering, responsive layout
- Input: Test controlled/uncontrolled modes, validation states, accessibility
