# Story 2.4: Implement Theme & Dark Mode Toggler

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED**

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to switch between light and dark modes,
**so that** I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A theme provider is configured at the root of the Next.js application.
2. A UI control (e.g., a button with a sun/moon icon) is added to the main layout.
3. Clicking the control instantly toggles the application's color scheme between light and dark mode.
4. The user's theme preference is persisted across sessions (e.g., using local storage).
5. All components on the `/showcase` page render correctly in both light and dark modes.

## Documentation Impact Assessment

This story establishes a fundamental user experience feature that affects the entire application:

- **User Experience**: Provides users with comfortable viewing options for different environments
- **Accessibility**: Supports users who prefer or require dark mode for visual comfort
- **Design System**: Extends the existing UI components to support dual theme modes
- **Technical Foundation**: Sets up theming infrastructure for future design enhancements

### Technical Context

**Data Models**: No specific data models required, but theme state management needed. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**API Specifications**: No API endpoints required for this story - theme management is client-side only.

**Component Specifications**: [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js version: 14.2.x specified in tech stack for frontend application
- Theme provider integration with Next.js app router structure
- Tailwind CSS dark mode configuration (class-based strategy recommended)
- ShadCN/UI components must support both light and dark themes
- React state management for theme switching

**File Locations**: Based on project structure guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- Next.js application: `apps/web/` (main web application)
- Root layout: `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` (for ThemeProvider setup)
- Theme toggle component: `apps/web/components/theme/` (new directory for theme-related components)
- UI components source: `packages/ui/src/` (existing components need dark mode support)
- Showcase page: `apps/web/app/showcase/page.tsx` (existing page to test theme switching)

**Testing Requirements**: Following test strategy standards [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

- Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test theme provider functionality and state management
- Test theme toggle component interactions
- Test theme persistence across browser sessions
- Coverage targets: 85%+ statements, 80%+ branches for new components
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting (not `bun test`)

**Technical Constraints**:

- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- No use of `any` type allowed [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- Follow established file naming conventions [Source: CLAUDE.md#important-conventions]
- Next.js version must match tech stack specification (14.2.x) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must handle SSR hydration issues properly for theme provider

### Technical Implementation Notes

**Theme Provider Options**:

- `next-themes` is the recommended library for Next.js applications
- Provides built-in support for system preference detection
- Handles SSR/hydration issues automatically
- Integrates well with Tailwind CSS dark mode

**Tailwind CSS Configuration**:

- Enable dark mode with class strategy: `darkMode: 'class'`
- Update existing components to include dark mode variants
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming

**Icon Requirements**:

- Sun icon for light mode indication
- Moon icon for dark mode indication
- Consider using Lucide React icons (already used in ShadCN/UI)

**Accessibility Considerations**:

- Proper ARIA labels for theme toggle button
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance in both themes
- Screen reader announcements for theme changes

### Project Structure Notes

Based on architecture guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- ✅ `apps/web/` directory is defined as the Next.js frontend application
- ✅ App router structure supports layout modifications at `app/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Component organization follows established patterns from previous stories
- ✅ Aligns with established monorepo pattern

**No structural conflicts identified** - the story requirements align perfectly with the defined architecture.

### Pattern Validation

**Architectural Patterns**: Theme provider pattern is standard for React applications and Next.js.

**Component Integration**: Must follow established ShadCN/UI integration patterns from Story 2.1 implementation.

**State Management**: Theme state should be managed at the application root level for global accessibility.

### Testing

**Test Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Use Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Test theme provider setup and configuration
- Test theme toggle interactions and state changes
- Test theme persistence using mock localStorage
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting
- Coverage targets: 85% statements, 80% branches for apps/web

**Test File Locations**: `apps/web/__tests__/` or co-located with components

**Testing Frameworks**:

- Jest for test runner and assertions [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- React Testing Library for component testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- jsdom environment for localStorage testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Theme provider initializes correctly
- Theme toggle button changes theme state
- Theme preference persists across page reloads
- Components render correctly in both light and dark modes
- Accessibility attributes are properly set
