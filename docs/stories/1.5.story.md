## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From **Story 1.4 - Convex Backend Integration**:

- Convex backend is fully integrated and working with real-time data connection
- ConvexProvider is configured and working in Next.js app layout
- Environment variables are properly set up for Convex connection
- Next.js App Router with TypeScript is working
- Cloudflare Pages deployment is maintained and compatible
- Real-time query patterns established with React hooks
- Development workflow with dual dev servers (Next.js + Convex) is working

### Tech Stack Configuration

Based on architecture documents, the following authentication technologies must be used:

- **BetterAuth**: Latest version for authentication service with first-party Convex adapter [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Convex**: 1.12.x for real-time backend platform, database, and functions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Next.js**: 14.2.x with App Router and TypeScript integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Zod**: 3.23.x for schema validation and type enforcement [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.x with strict mode enabled [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Data Models and Schema

The authentication system must implement the following data models:

**User Schema** (from existing data model):

```typescript
// From architecture/data-models.md
Table users {
  _id id [primary key]
  name string
  email string [unique, not null]
  profile_image_url string [note: 'Optional URL for user avatar']
  role string [not null, default: '"user"']
  _creationTime timestamp
}
```

**For this story, implement**:

- User registration with email/password authentication
- Session management with secure token storage
- User profile data structure following established schema
- Role-based access control foundation (default: "user")

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

The authentication system must implement the following Convex functions:

**Authentication Queries**:

- `users:getCurrentUser()`: `Query<UserProfile | null>` - Get current authenticated user [Source: architecture/api-implementation-details.md]
- Session verification and user profile retrieval
- Protected query patterns for authenticated content

**Authentication Mutations**:

- User registration functionality
- Session management mutations
- User profile updates
- `theme:updateUserTheme(args: { settings: object })`: `Mutation<void>` for future user preferences [Source: architecture/api-implementation-details.md]

**For this story**:

- Create authentication-related Convex functions
- Follow established query/mutation patterns from Story 1.4
- Ensure TypeScript integration with function signatures
- Implement BetterAuth adapter integration

### Technical Constraints

From architecture requirements and BetterAuth specifications:

**BetterAuth Integration**:

- Must use first-party Convex adapter for seamless integration
- Compatible with Next.js App Router and TypeScript strict mode
- Server-side session management with secure token handling
- Compatible with Cloudflare Pages deployment (client-side auth)

**Security Requirements**:

- Zod schema validation for all authentication inputs [Source: architecture/security.md]
- Secure session storage and token management
- Input validation and sanitization for auth forms
- Protection against common auth vulnerabilities

**Environment Configuration**:

- BetterAuth secret keys and configuration
- Convex integration with authentication adapter
- Development vs production environment separation
- No server-side rendering conflicts with static export

**Monorepo Integration**:

- BetterAuth packages compatible with Bun package manager
- TypeScript workspace references for shared auth types
- Development workflow integration with existing Convex setup
- No conflicts with existing Cloudflare Pages deployment

### Coding Standards

The authentication implementation must follow established standards:

**TypeScript Requirements**:

- Strict mode enabled for all authentication functions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- No `any` type usage in authentication schemas or functions [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Full type safety with BetterAuth and Convex integration [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Configuration Pattern**:

- No direct `process.env` access in client code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Centralized configuration management for authentication [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Environment-specific configurations for development and production

**Repository Pattern** (Future Implementation):

- All authentication data access through repository pattern [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Separation of business logic from authentication data access [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Abstract authentication layer for testability

### Security Considerations

For optimal authentication security:

**BetterAuth Security Features**:

- Built-in protection against common auth vulnerabilities
- Secure session token generation and management
- CSRF protection and secure cookie handling
- Password hashing and validation best practices

**Input Validation**:

- Zod schema validation for all authentication inputs
- Email format validation and sanitization
- Password strength requirements and validation
- Prevention of SQL injection and XSS attacks

**Session Management**:

- Secure session storage with httpOnly cookies
- Session expiration and refresh token handling
- Logout functionality with proper session cleanup
- Protection against session hijacking

### Performance Considerations

For optimal authentication performance:

**Authentication Flow**:

- Efficient session verification with minimal database calls
- Optimistic UI updates during authentication actions
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Minimal impact on application bundle size

**Development Workflow**:

- Fast development experience with hot reload
- TypeScript compilation performance with auth types
- Integration with existing Convex development workflow
- Compatible with Next.js static export for Cloudflare Pages

### Pattern Validation

Reference existing patterns that must be followed during implementation:

- React Provider pattern for authentication context (established in Story 1.4)
- TypeScript integration patterns (established in previous stories)
- Environment configuration patterns (established in Story 1.3)
- Convex query/mutation patterns (established in Story 1.4)

This story will establish new foundational patterns for:

- BetterAuth integration with Convex backend
- Authentication state management in Next.js App Router
- Protected route patterns for client-side authorization
- User registration and login flow patterns

### Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

- **Unit Testing**: Jest/RTL for authentication components and functions [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Integration Testing**: Ephemeral Convex environments for authentication flow testing [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% coverage requirement for authentication packages [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **CI/CD Integration**: All authentication tests integrated into pipeline [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

For this authentication story, testing involves:

- Test the BetterAuth integration with Convex backend
- Test user registration and login functionality
- Test session management and verification
- Test protected route authorization
- Test authentication UI components and forms
- Test error handling and edge cases in auth flow
- Integration test with existing Next.js and Convex setup
- Verify no regression in Cloudflare Pages deployment
