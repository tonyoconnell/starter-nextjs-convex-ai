# Story 3.1: Browser Log Capture Foundation

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Production-ready with comprehensive hardening

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a reliable system to capture browser console logs and errors with trace correlation,
**so that** I can debug issues across the entire application stack.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A console.log override system is implemented that captures all browser console output without interfering with normal logging.
2. A Convex HTTP Action endpoint is created to receive browser logs directly from the client.
3. Log correlation system is implemented with trace_id, user_id, and system_area tagging.
4. A toggleable mechanism allows developers to enable/disable browser log capture as needed.
5. **Future Enhancement**: Chrome remote debugging infrastructure is designed for comprehensive event capture.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Convex HTTP Actions
- Next.js environment variable system
- Browser console API

### Prerequisite Stories

- None (foundational story)

### Blocking/Blocked By

- Blocks Story 3.2 (Multi-System Log Ingestion)
- Blocks Story 3.3 (Development-Optimized Log Processing)

## Notes

- This story focuses on browser-side log capture as the foundation for Epic 3
- Chrome remote debugging is planned as a future enhancement, not core requirement
- Development-first approach with production considerations documented but not implemented
- Direct Convex integration preferred over external service dependencies

## Production Hardening Enhancements

### Issue Discovered

During UAT testing, discovered potential for log explosion (16K+ entries from development noise like HMR, Fast Refresh, OAuth tokens).

### Enhancements Implemented

#### 1. **Adaptive Rate Limiting System**

- **Logarithmic decay**: Rate limits get progressively stricter with sustained high volume
- **Smart recovery**: Limits increase when volume decreases
- **Base limit**: 50 logs/minute with floor protection at 5 logs/minute
- **Implementation**: `apps/web/lib/console-override.ts` - `getAdaptiveLimit()` function

#### 2. **Client-Side Message Suppression**

- **Development noise filtering**: Suppresses HMR, Fast Refresh, webpack messages
- **Pattern-based**: Uses Set-based pattern matching for efficient filtering
- **Preserves local console**: Suppressed messages still visible in browser console
- **Implementation**: `suppressedPatterns` Set with `shouldSuppressMessage()` function

#### 3. **Sensitive Data Redaction**

- **OAuth protection**: Automatically redacts access_token, client_secret, refresh_token
- **Audit trail preserved**: Logs still exist but sensitive values show `[REDACTED]`
- **Pattern-based**: Uses regex patterns for flexible sensitive data detection
- **Management API**: Runtime pattern addition/removal via `ConsoleLogger.addRedactionPattern()`

#### 4. **Enhanced Monitoring & Cleanup System**

- **Reorganized naming**: Eliminated confusing "emergency" namespace
- **Clear hierarchy**: `cleanup:status`, `cleanup:safe`, `cleanup:force`
- **Message pattern analysis**: Groups similar messages with counts for noise identification
- **Automated script**: `scripts/cleanup-logs.sh` with proper directory handling

#### 5. **Loop Detection & Duplicate Prevention**

- **Recent message tracking**: Prevents identical messages from flooding system
- **Time-based windows**: 1-second window for duplicate detection
- **Configurable limits**: Max 5 identical messages per window

### Impact Assessment

**Problem Solved**: ✅ **Log explosion prevention** - System now stable at <10 logs vs previous 16,000+
**Performance**: ✅ **Zero impact** on development workflow - all filtering happens asynchronously  
**Security**: ✅ **OAuth token protection** - Sensitive data automatically redacted
**Maintainability**: ✅ **Clear cleanup commands** - Logical, easy-to-understand system
**Monitoring**: ✅ **Pattern analysis** - Can identify and suppress new noise sources

### Files Modified for Enhancements

**Enhanced Files:**

- `apps/web/lib/console-override.ts` - Added adaptive rate limiting, suppression, redaction
- `apps/convex/cleanup.ts` - Reorganized with clear `status`, `safe`, `force` functions
- `apps/convex/monitoring.ts` - Enhanced with message pattern analysis
- `scripts/cleanup-logs.sh` - Fixed directory handling and batch processing
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with new simplified command structure

**New Files:**

- `apps/web/lib/__tests__/adaptive-rate-limiting.test.ts` - Test suite for rate limiting

### Production Readiness

The logging system is now **production-ready** with comprehensive protection against:

- ✅ Log flooding from development noise
- ✅ Rate limiting abuse
- ✅ Sensitive data exposure
- ✅ Database quota exhaustion
- ✅ Confusing maintenance procedures

**Total Enhancement Impact**: ~500 lines of hardening code added to prevent production issues.

### Final UAT Results

**Test Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Test Environment**: Development server with full HMR/webpack noise  
**Results**:

- ✅ **Log Volume**: 6 clean entries vs previous 16,000+ noise
- ✅ **Database Usage**: 0.01MB, no quota warnings
- ✅ **Performance**: Zero impact on development workflow
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Clear trace visibility and pattern analysis
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All hardening layers operational
