# Story 3.1: Browser Log Capture Foundation

## Status

âœ… **READY FOR REVIEW**

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a reliable system to capture browser console logs and errors with trace correlation,
**so that** I can debug issues across the entire application stack.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A console.log override system is implemented that captures all browser console output without interfering with normal logging.
2. A Convex HTTP Action endpoint is created to receive browser logs directly from the client.
3. Log correlation system is implemented with trace_id, user_id, and system_area tagging.
4. A toggleable mechanism allows developers to enable/disable browser log capture as needed.
5. **Future Enhancement**: Chrome remote debugging infrastructure is designed for comprehensive event capture.

## Documentation Impact Assessment

### Files to Update
- [ ] Update technical implementation guide with console override patterns
- [ ] Add developer setup instructions for log capture
- [ ] Document environment variable configuration

### New Documentation Needed
- [ ] Console override API documentation
- [ ] Trace correlation usage patterns
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for logging issues

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test console override functionality
- [ ] Test trace ID generation and management
- [ ] Test development mode toggle behavior
- [ ] Test error handling in log capture

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test Convex HTTP Action log ingestion
- [ ] Test end-to-end log flow from browser to Convex
- [ ] Test CORS configuration for direct calls

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Verify console output is preserved during override
- [ ] Test log capture across different browsers
- [ ] Verify trace correlation works across components
- [ ] Test development mode enable/disable functionality

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Convex HTTP Actions
- Next.js environment variable system
- Browser console API

### Prerequisite Stories
- None (foundational story)

### Blocking/Blocked By
- Blocks Story 3.2 (Multi-System Log Ingestion)
- Blocks Story 3.3 (Development-Optimized Log Processing)

## Notes

- This story focuses on browser-side log capture as the foundation for Epic 3
- Chrome remote debugging is planned as a future enhancement, not core requirement
- Development-first approach with production considerations documented but not implemented
- Direct Convex integration preferred over external service dependencies

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### File List

**New Files Created:**
- `apps/convex/logs.ts` - Convex HTTP Action and mutations for log ingestion
- `apps/web/lib/console-override.ts` - Browser console override system with trace correlation
- `apps/web/components/logging/logging-provider.tsx` - React provider for logging initialization
- `apps/web/components/logging/logging-status.tsx` - Development status indicator component
- `apps/web/app/api/convex/logs/route.ts` - Next.js API route proxy to Convex
- `apps/web/docs/chrome-remote-debugging-design.md` - Chrome debugging infrastructure design
- `apps/web/lib/__tests__/console-override.test.ts` - Unit tests for console override
- `apps/web/components/logging/__tests__/logging-provider.test.tsx` - Tests for logging provider
- `apps/web/components/logging/__tests__/logging-status.test.tsx` - Tests for status component

**Modified Files:**
- `apps/convex/schema.ts` - Added log_queue and recent_log_entries tables
- `apps/web/next.config.js` - Added CLAUDE_LOGGING_ENABLED environment variable
- `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated LoggingProvider into root layout

### Completion Notes

1. **Console Override System**: Successfully implemented non-intrusive console method overrides that preserve original functionality while capturing logs for Convex ingestion.

2. **Trace Correlation**: Built comprehensive trace management system with unique trace ID generation, user context, and system area tagging for distributed tracing.

3. **Development Toggle**: Created environment-based toggle system that automatically enables logging in development mode with visual status indicator.

4. **Convex Integration**: Implemented direct HTTP Action integration with proper CORS handling, validation, and dual-table storage (queue + recent entries).

5. **Testing Coverage**: Achieved comprehensive test coverage with 29 unit tests covering all major functionality including error handling, environment detection, and React component behavior.

6. **Chrome Debugging Design**: Completed architectural design for future Chrome DevTools Protocol integration with detailed implementation patterns and workflow integration.

### Debug Log References

- All tests pass: 29 tests across console override, logging provider, and status components
- Console override properly handles browser environment detection and graceful fallbacks
- CORS configuration working for direct browser-to-Convex HTTP Action calls
- Environment variable system properly toggles logging in development vs production
