# Story 1.9: Comprehensive Testing & Coverage

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE - SIGNED OFF**

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive test coverage (90-95%) across the entire application,
**so that** I can confidently deploy changes knowing the system is thoroughly validated and regression-free.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit tests are implemented for all React components with meaningful test scenarios.
2. Unit tests cover all utility functions, helpers, and custom hooks.
3. Integration tests validate all Convex queries, mutations, and backend functions.
4. End-to-end tests cover critical user journeys (registration, login, logout, protected routes).
5. Authentication flow tests validate all auth scenarios (email/password, OAuth, password reset).
6. Test coverage reports show 90-95% coverage across the codebase.
7. All tests run successfully in the CI/CD pipeline and block deployment on failures.
8. Test configuration supports both local development and CI environments.

### Tech Stack Configuration

Based on architecture documents, the following testing technologies and their configurations:

- **Jest**: Latest version for unit and integration testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **React Testing Library**: Latest version for component testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Playwright**: Latest version for end-to-end browser automation testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Bun**: 1.1.x as JS Runtime, Package Manager, and Test Runner [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Faker.js**: 8.4.x for realistic mock data generation for testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Data Models

From existing data models, testing needs to cover:

```dbml
Table users {
  _id id [primary key]
  name string
  email string [unique, not null]
  profile_image_url string
  role string [not null, default: '"user"']
  _creationTime timestamp
}

Table chat_sessions {
  _id id [primary key]
  user_id id [not null]
  title string
  _creationTime timestamp
}

Table chat_messages {
  _id id [primary key]
  session_id id [not null]
  user_id id [not null]
  role string [not null]
  content text [not null]
  _creationTime timestamp
}

Table log_entries {
  _id id [primary key]
  correlation_id string [not null]
  user_id id [note: 'Nullable']
  level string [not null]
  message text [not null]
  source string [not null]
  context object
  _creationTime timestamp
}
```

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

Testing must cover all CRUD operations, relationships, and data validation for these models.

### Technical Constraints

From architecture requirements and testing best practices:

**Coverage Requirements**:

- Frontend Components: 95% line coverage target
- Utility Functions: 95% line coverage target
- Convex Functions: 90% line coverage target
- Authentication Flows: 95% line coverage target
- Critical User Journeys: 100% E2E coverage target

**Testing Standards**:

- All tests must be maintainable and fast-executing
- Flaky tests are not acceptable and must be fixed or removed
- Mock strategies for external dependencies and Convex functions
- Test data factories for consistent test scenarios

[Source: Epic 1.9 Requirements]

### Coding Standards

The testing implementation must follow established standards:

**TypeScript Requirements**:

- Strict mode enabled with no `any` types in test code
- Full type safety for all test functions and mocks
- Proper error handling with typed test assertions

**Repository Pattern**:

- Test data access through repository pattern
- Abstraction between test logic and data access
- Centralized test configuration management

**Correlation IDs**:

- Test requests must include correlation IDs where applicable
- Test logging must include correlation ID for traceability

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Strategy

Pyramid-based strategy with comprehensive coverage:

**Unit Testing**:

- Jest with React Testing Library for component and function testing
- Mock strategies for Convex functions and external dependencies
- Test data factories for consistent scenarios
- Fast-executing tests with proper isolation

**Integration Testing**:

- Ephemeral Convex environments for backend testing
- Full authentication flow testing
- Data model and relationship testing
- Email service integration testing (mock and real)

**End-to-End Testing**:

- Playwright for critical-path user journey testing
- Complete user registration, login, and authentication flows
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Real user interaction simulation

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Security Considerations

Testing must validate security measures:

**Authentication Security**:

- Token expiration testing (password reset tokens, session tokens)
- OAuth flow security validation
- Session management security testing
- Authentication guard testing for protected routes

**Data Protection**:

- Input validation testing with Zod schemas
- Secure data handling testing
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Security boundary testing for user data access

[Source: architecture/security.md]

### Pattern Validation

Reference existing patterns that must be followed during testing implementation:

- Testing patterns from existing Stories 1.1-1.8 implementations
- Component testing patterns with React Testing Library
- Backend testing patterns for Convex functions
- Error handling patterns for test scenarios
- Configuration management patterns for test environments

This story will establish new foundational patterns for:

- Comprehensive test coverage implementation
- Multi-layer testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Test data factory design and usage
- Coverage reporting and quality gate enforcement
- CI/CD testing integration and automation

### Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for component and function testing

- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright for critical-path user journey testing
- **Coverage Reporting**: 90% coverage requirement with threshold enforcement
- **CI/CD Integration**: All tests run in GitHub Actions with deployment blocking

For this testing story, comprehensive validation involves:

- Test all existing components and functions implemented in Stories 1.1-1.8

- Test user management and session handling
- Validate form validation and error handling
