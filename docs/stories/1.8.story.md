## Documentation Impact Assessment

This story establishes critical authentication patterns for the entire project:

- **OAuth Integration Pattern**: Complete social login implementation with BetterAuth
- **Password Security Pattern**: Secure password management with time-limited tokens
- **Session Management Pattern**: Persistent vs temporary session handling
- **Authentication Form Pattern**: Comprehensive form design for authentication flows
- **Mock Email Integration Pattern**: Development-ready email simulation for testing authentication flows

This implementation will create new patterns that should be documented for:

- BetterAuth social provider configuration patterns
- Secure password reset flow implementation with mock email service
- OAuth callback handling and user profile synchronization
- Extended session management for "Remember Me" functionality
- Multi-provider authentication system architecture
- Mock email service pattern for development without external dependencies

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From **Story 1.7 - Port Management Documentation**:

- Complete development environment is established with clear port management
- CI/CD pipeline is stable and automated
- Foundation is in place for comprehensive development
- Development workflow is well-documented and tested
- All previous authentication (Story 1.5) provides the foundation for extended features

### Tech Stack Configuration

Based on architecture documents, the following technologies and their authentication configurations:

- **BetterAuth**: Latest version with first-party Convex adapter [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Next.js**: 14.2.x with App Router for authentication pages [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Convex**: 1.12.x real-time backend with integrated authentication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Zod**: 3.23.x for schema validation of authentication forms [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.x with strict mode for type safety [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Data Models

From existing data models, the user table supports extended authentication:

```dbml
Table users {
  _id id [primary key]
  name string
  email string [unique, not null]
  profile_image_url string [note: 'Optional URL for user avatar']
  role string [not null, default: '"user"']
  _creationTime timestamp
}
```

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

The existing user model supports OAuth profile synchronization through the `profile_image_url` field and can be extended as needed for additional OAuth provider data.

### API Specifications

From existing API specifications, authentication is handled through:

**Convex Backend Functions**:
- `users:getCurrentUser()`: `Query<UserProfile | null>` - Already implemented for user session
- Authentication flows integrate with existing user management system

[Source: architecture/api-implementation-details.md]

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technical Constraints

From architecture requirements and authentication best practices:

**Security Requirements**:
- Password reset tokens expire within 1 hour (Epic requirement)
- Email verification links expire within 24 hours (Epic requirement)
- All authentication flows must use secure, time-limited tokens
- OAuth providers must be configured with proper security scopes

**BetterAuth Integration**:
- Use first-party Convex adapter for seamless integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing authentication system
- Follow BetterAuth best practices for social providers
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

**Mock Email Service Requirements**:
- Create development-only email service that logs to console/debug
- Generate realistic email content for password reset tokens
- Provide development UI to view "sent" emails for testing
- Implement email service interface that can be easily swapped for production
- Store mock emails in memory/local storage for development testing
- Include proper token validation and expiration handling

[Source: architecture/security.md]

### Coding Standards

The authentication features must follow established standards:

**TypeScript Requirements**:
- Strict mode enabled with no `any` types
- Full type safety for all authentication functions
- Proper error handling with typed error responses

**Repository Pattern**:
- All data access through repository pattern
- Abstraction between business logic and data access
- Centralized configuration management (no direct `process.env`)

**Correlation IDs**:
- All authentication requests must include correlation IDs
- Logging must include correlation ID for traceability

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Strategy

The authentication features must include comprehensive testing:

**Unit Testing**:
- All authentication functions tested with Jest
- Form validation tested with React Testing Library
- Mock OAuth providers for testing social login flows
- Password security validation testing

**Integration Testing**:
- End-to-end authentication flows with Playwright
- OAuth callback handling testing
- Session management testing
- Mock email service integration testing
- Password reset flow testing with mock emails

**Security Testing**:
- Password reset token expiration testing
- OAuth security flow validation
- Session security testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Security Considerations

For production-ready authentication:

**Authentication Security**:
- Secure token generation and validation
- Proper session management with secure cookies
- OAuth provider security configuration
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

**Data Protection**:
- Secure password hashing and storage
- Proper handling of sensitive user data
- Secure OAuth token storage and handling
- Protection against common authentication attacks

[Source: architecture/security.md]

### Pattern Validation

Reference existing patterns that must be followed during implementation:

- Authentication patterns established in Story 1.5 (foundational authentication)
- Form validation patterns using Zod schemas
- Component architecture patterns for UI consistency
- Error handling patterns for user feedback
- Configuration management patterns for OAuth providers

This story will establish new foundational patterns for:

- Multi-provider OAuth integration
- Secure password management workflows
- Extended session management
- Mock email service for development environments
- Comprehensive authentication form design

### Mock Email Service Implementation Guide

**Core Interface Design**:
```typescript
interface EmailService {
  sendPasswordResetEmail(email: string, token: string): Promise<void>;
  sendVerificationEmail(email: string, token: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Mock Implementation Requirements**:
- Log all email content to console with clear formatting
- Store emails in memory for development UI viewing
- Generate realistic email templates with reset links
- Include proper token validation and expiration
- Provide clear development-only indicators

**Development UI Features**:
- View all "sent" emails in chronological order
- Display email content with proper formatting
- Show token expiration status
- Allow copying reset links for testing
- Clear all mock emails functionality

**Production Transition Strategy**:
- Use environment variables to switch between mock and real email services
- Implement same interface for production email service
- Ensure seamless transition without code changes to consumers
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing flows

### Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for component and function testing
- **Integration Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end authentication flow testing
- **Security Testing**: Validate token expiration, session security, and OAuth flows
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure authentication works across different browsers

For this authentication story, testing involves:

- Test all password change and reset functionality
- Validate OAuth integration with GitHub and Google
- Test "Remember Me" session persistence
- Verify backward compatibility with existing authentication
- Test token expiration and security measures
- Validate form validation and error handling
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Verify integration with existing user management system
- **Mock Email Service Testing**:
  - Test email content generation and formatting
  - Validate token inclusion in mock emails
  - Test development UI for viewing sent emails
  - Verify email service interface compatibility for production transition
