# Story 4.2: Implement the Knowledge Ingestion Service

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a backend service to process documents, create vector embeddings, store them in our Vector DB, and integrate with real LLM capabilities,
**so that** our AI has a knowledge base to retrieve context from and can provide actual AI-powered responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Convex action `knowledge:addDocument` is created.
2. This action takes text content as input.
3. It uses a library to generate vector embeddings for chunks of the document text.
4. The text chunks and their embeddings are successfully stored in our Cloudflare Vectorize DB.
5. The seeding script is configured to process all key project documents in `/docs` and key source code files in `apps/` and `packages/`.
6. OpenRouter API integration is implemented for actual LLM responses instead of placeholder responses.
7. Environment-based configuration is added for OPENROUTER_API_KEY and LLM_MODEL selection.
8. User-based LLM access control is implemented with a database flag, with graceful fallback to basic chat responses for unauthorized users.
9. Model selection and configuration support multiple OpenRouter models with fallback options.

### Previous Story Insights

From [Source: 4.1.story.md - Dev Agent Record]:

- Chat UI infrastructure is complete with proper TypeScript types
- Established patterns for message handling and real-time updates
- Created chat types at `apps/web/types/chat.ts` - extend for knowledge context
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Console override system available for debugging RAG integration

### Data Models

From [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

**Existing Schema Foundation:**

- `users` table with user context and IDs for security
- `chat_sessions` and `chat_messages` for conversation tracking
- `log_entries` with correlation_id patterns for debugging

**Required Extensions for Vector Storage:**

- New table/collection for document chunks with metadata
- Vector embeddings stored in Cloudflare Vectorize (external to Convex)
- Mapping table to link Convex documents to Vectorize entries
- Source document tracking with file paths and modification times

### API Specifications

From [Source: architecture/api-implementation-details.md]:

**Required Convex Action Signature:**

```typescript
// Knowledge ingestion action
"knowledge:addDocument": Action<{
  content: string;
  source: string;
  metadata?: object;
}> -> { documentId: string; chunksCreated: number; }

// LLM integration action
"agent:generateResponse": Action<{
  sessionId: Id<"chatSessions">;
  message: string;
  model?: string;
}> -> { response: string; model: string; tokensUsed: number; }

// User LLM access control query
"auth:checkUserLLMAccess": Query<{
  userId: Id<"users">;
}> -> { hasLLMAccess: boolean; fallbackMessage?: string; }

// Future RAG query action (referenced for context)
"agent:runRAGQuery": Action<{
  sessionId: Id<"chatSessions">;
  message: string;
}> -> void
```

**Integration Requirements:**

- Use Actions (not Mutations) for external Vectorize API calls
- Follow repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Include correlation IDs for all operations (from logging patterns)

### File Locations

From [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

**New Files to Create:**

- `apps/convex/knowledge.ts` - Knowledge ingestion and LLM integration actions
- `apps/convex/auth.ts` - User access control queries and utilities
- `apps/convex/schema.ts` - Update with document metadata tables
- `scripts/seed-knowledge.ts` - Document seeding script
- `packages/shared-types/knowledge.ts` - Shared types (if needed)
- `packages/shared-types/llm.ts` - LLM integration types and interfaces
- `apps/web/lib/config.ts` - Environment configuration management
- `apps/web/lib/openrouter.ts` - OpenRouter API client wrapper

**Configuration Files:**

- Environment variables for Vectorize DB connection in `.env.local`
- Environment variables for OpenRouter API configuration (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`)
- Cloudflare Vectorize configuration (external to codebase)
- Access control configuration for authorized users

### Integration Patterns

From [Source: patterns/backend-patterns.md]:

**Action Function Structure:**

- Use `action()` wrapper for external API integrations
- No direct database access from actions - call mutations for Convex data
- Handle external API errors with proper retry logic
- Include proper logging with correlation IDs

**External API Integration Pattern:**

```typescript
export const addDocument = action({
  args: { content: v.string(), source: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Generate embeddings via external API
    // Store in Vectorize DB
    // Update Convex metadata via mutation
    // Return results with proper error handling
  },
});
```

**OpenRouter LLM Integration Pattern:**

```typescript
export const generateResponse = action({
  args: { 
    sessionId: v.id("chatSessions"), 
    message: v.string(),
    model: v.optional(v.string())
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Check user access control
    // Select appropriate model based on config/args
    // Call OpenRouter API with proper error handling
    // Track token usage and costs
    // Store response in chat session
    // Return structured response with metadata
  },
});
```

**Access Control Pattern:**

```typescript
export const checkUserLLMAccess = query({
  args: { userId: v.id("users") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Query user record for hasLLMAccess flag
    // Return access status with fallback messaging
    // Log access checks for monitoring
    // Provide clear instructions for requesting access
  },
});
```

### Cloudflare Vectorize Configuration

From [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:

**Platform Integration:**

- Edge-first architecture ensures global performance
- Integration with existing Cloudflare infrastructure (Pages, Workers)

**Required Setup:**

- Vectorize database creation via Cloudflare dashboard or API
- API keys and endpoint configuration
- Index configuration for vector dimensions (typically 1536 for OpenAI embeddings)

### OpenRouter LLM Configuration

**API Integration Requirements:**

- OpenRouter API key configuration via environment variables
- Model selection and fallback configuration
- Cost tracking and usage monitoring
- Rate limiting and error handling

**Supported Models:**

- `claude-3-haiku` - Fast, cost-effective for simple queries
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Balanced performance and cost
- `claude-3-sonnet` - High-quality responses for complex queries
- Configurable fallback chain for reliability

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LLM_MODEL=claude-3-haiku  # Default model selection
LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Fallback if primary fails
```

**Access Control Configuration:**

- Database-driven LLM access control via `hasLLMAccess` user flag
