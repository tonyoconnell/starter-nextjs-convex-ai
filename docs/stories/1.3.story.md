- **Performance Optimization**: Edge deployment and global CDN distribution
- **Deployment Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for manual and automated deployment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From **Story 1.2 - Basic Next.js App Shell**:

- Next.js 14.2.15 application successfully created with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode configured and working
- Tailwind CSS integrated and styles applied correctly
- Development server runs on port 3000 without conflicts
- Build process completes without errors
- Homepage displays welcome message with proper styling
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo integration established

### Tech Stack Configuration

Based on architecture documents, the following deployment technologies must be used:

- **Cloudflare Pages**: Platform for hosting and edge services [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Next.js**: 14.2.x with static site generation capabilities [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Wrangler CLI**: Cloudflare's deployment tool [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment (future story) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Bun**: 1.1.x for build and deployment scripts [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Deployment Architecture

The deployment setup must align with the infrastructure strategy:

**Infrastructure from Code Approach**:

- Wrangler CLI managing deployments to Cloudflare
- Continuous Deployment model for main branch (future automation)
- Automatic preview deployments for pull requests (future)
- Rollbacks via Cloudflare's instant rollback feature

[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]

### Project Structure Requirements

The deployment configuration must follow the established project structure:

```plaintext
/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml           # GitHub Actions for CI/CD (future)
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                 # The Next.js frontend application
│   │   ├── wrangler.toml    # Cloudflare Pages configuration
│   │   ├── package.json     # Updated with deployment scripts
│   │   └── next.config.js   # Updated with Cloudflare adapter
├── docs/
│   └── deployment-guide.md  # Deployment documentation
```

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Cloudflare Pages Configuration

The Cloudflare Pages project must be configured for Next.js deployment:

**Build Configuration**:

- Build command: `bun run build`
- Output directory: `apps/web/dist` or `apps/web/.next`
- Node.js compatibility: Latest LTS version
- Environment variables: None required for this story

**Pages Functions**:

- Will be configured for future API routes
- Currently not needed for static site deployment

**Custom Domain**:

- Optional for this story
- Will use default `*.pages.dev` URL

### File Locations

Following the established project structure:

**Cloudflare Configuration**:

- `apps/web/wrangler.toml` - Cloudflare Pages configuration
- `apps/web/package.json` - Updated with deployment scripts
- `apps/web/next.config.js` - Updated with Cloudflare adapter settings

**Documentation**:

- `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with deployment instructions

**Build Output**:

- `apps/web/dist/` - Cloudflare Pages build output
- `apps/web/.next/` - Next.js build artifacts

### Technical Constraints

From architecture requirements and Cloudflare Pages limitations:

**Next.js Compatibility**:

- Must use static site generation (SSG) for initial deployment
- App Router compatibility with Cloudflare Pages
- No server-side rendering (SSR) in this story
- Edge runtime compatibility required

**Build Requirements**:

- Bun package manager compatibility
- Turborepo integration maintained
- TypeScript compilation in production mode
- Tailwind CSS optimization for production

**Performance Considerations**:

- Global CDN distribution via Cloudflare
- Edge caching and optimization
- Static asset optimization
- Fast page load times

### Coding Standards

The deployment configuration must follow established standards:

**Configuration Files**:

- TypeScript strict mode maintained in production
- No direct `process.env` access in client code
- Centralized configuration management for deployment settings

**Environment Variables**:

- Secure handling of any deployment secrets
- No hardcoded values in configuration files
- Environment-specific configurations

### Testing Requirements

Based on testing strategy for deployment:

**Deployment Testing**:

- Build process validation
- Static asset verification
- Performance testing on live site
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Integration Testing**:

- Local build with Cloudflare adapter
- Production build verification
- CDN caching validation

**Manual Testing**:

- Live site functionality verification
- Performance and loading time testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

### Security Considerations

For deployment security:

**Access Control**:

- Secure Cloudflare account access
- Proper API token management
- Build process security

**Content Security**:

- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy headers
- Secure asset delivery

### Performance Optimization

For optimal deployment performance:

**Build Optimization**:

- Next.js static optimization
- Tailwind CSS purging
- Asset minification and compression
- Tree shaking for JavaScript bundles

**CDN Optimization**:

- Global edge distribution
- Cache headers configuration
- Static asset optimization

### Documentation Requirements

Comprehensive deployment documentation must include:

**Setup Guide**:

- Cloudflare account setup
- Wrangler CLI installation
- Project configuration steps

**Deployment Process**:

- Manual deployment steps
- Build process explanation
- Troubleshooting common issues

**Rollback Procedures**:

- Deployment rollback process

## Pattern Validation

Reference existing patterns that must be followed during implementation:

- Check docs/patterns/ for deployment patterns (when available)
- Validate against existing examples in docs/examples/ (when available)
- Establish new deployment patterns for future automation
- Document Cloudflare Pages integration patterns

This story will establish the foundational deployment patterns for:

- Next.js static site generation
- Cloudflare Pages integration
- Edge deployment configuration
- Performance optimization

## Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

- **Deployment Testing**: Verify build process and live site functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Edge deployment performance validation
- **Integration Testing**: Cloudflare Pages with Next.js compatibility
- **Manual Testing**: Live site verification and user experience testing

For this deployment story, testing involves:

- Verify Next.js application builds successfully for production
- Test Cloudflare Pages deployment process
- Validate live site accessibility and functionality
- Confirm performance meets edge deployment standards
- Test deployment rollback procedures
