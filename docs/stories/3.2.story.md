# Story 3.2: Multi-System Log Ingestion & Correlation

## Status

Implementation Complete - Ready for QA Review
(Note: Task 4 deferred as lower priority - direct CORS approach working effectively)

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** logs from browser, Cloudflare Workers, and Convex backend to be correlated with trace IDs,
**so that** I can follow a complete request flow across all systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Convex HTTP Action endpoint handles browser console logs with CORS configuration.
2. Cloudflare Workers logging utilities are enhanced to propagate trace correlation data.
3. Convex Log Streams webhook integration captures backend function execution logs.
4. Log ingestion creates entries in both `log_queue` for processing and `recent_log_entries` for real-time viewing.
5. **Fallback**: Cloudflare Worker proxy is available if direct Convex CORS proves problematic.
6. **CRITICAL**: Multi-system logging implements Story 3.1's database protection patterns to prevent overload.
7. **BUDGET**: System maintains <$10/month cost constraint with distributed quota management across all log sources.
8. **COORDINATION**: Cross-system rate limiting prevents any single system from exhausting database quotas.

## Estimation & Planning

### Story Points

8

### Estimated Complexity

Medium-High

### Estimated Time

4-6 days (increased due to cross-system protection architecture complexity)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.1 completion:
- Console override system successfully implemented with trace correlation
- Convex HTTP Action already exists at `apps/convex/logs.ts` with CORS handling
- Database schema includes `log_queue` and `recent_log_entries` tables
- Trace correlation system working with trace_id, user_id, system_area tagging
- Direct browser-to-Convex calls validated and working
- **CRITICAL**: Sophisticated database protection architecture implemented to prevent 16K+ log explosions

### Database Protection Architecture (MUST EXTEND)

**Story 3.1 Protection Patterns** (MANDATORY for multi-system implementation):

1. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Logarithmic decay system (50→25→12→6 logs/minute) under sustained load
2. **Loop Detection**: Tracks identical messages within 1-second windows, max 5 duplicates
3. **Client-Side Suppression**: Pattern-based filtering for development noise (HMR, webpack, etc.)
4. **Sensitive Data Redaction**: OAuth token protection with configurable patterns
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Map-based tracking prevents message flooding

**Multi-System Risk**: Without extending these patterns, each new log source multiplies the database load risk exponentially.

**Required Architecture**: Unified rate limiting service with cross-system coordination and distributed quota management.

### Multi-System Rate Limiting Architecture

**Architectural Pattern: Centralized Rate Limiter with System Quotas**

```typescript
// Shared rate limiting state in Convex
interface SystemRateLimits {
  browser: { current: number; limit: number; resetTime: number };
  worker: { current: number; limit: number; resetTime: number };
  backend: { current: number; limit: number; resetTime: number };
  global: { current: number; limit: number; budget: number };
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Centralized Quota Management**: Single Convex table tracks per-system and global quotas
2. **Pre-Write Validation**: Each log source checks quota before writing to database
3. **Adaptive Scaling**: Per-system limits adjust based on global database pressure
4. **Budget Allocation**: $10/month budget distributed across systems (40% browser, 30% worker, 30% backend)

### Cost Constraint Validation Patterns

**From [Source: technical-guides/cost-effective-logging-in-convex-agentic-systems.md]**:
- Convex Professional Plan: 25M document writes @ $2.00 per million writes
- $10/month budget = ~125,000 total writes (including safety margin)
- Per-system quotas: Browser (50K), Worker (37.5K), Backend (37.5K)

**Cost Monitoring Architecture**:
```typescript
interface CostTracker {
  monthlyWrites: { browser: number; worker: number; backend: number };
  estimatedCost: number;
  budgetRemaining: number;
  alertThresholds: { warning: 0.8; critical: 0.95 };
}
```

**Real-time Cost Validation**:
1. Each write operation updates cost tracker
2. Pre-write validation blocks operations exceeding quota
3. Daily cost reports alert when approaching budget limits
4. Automatic degradation to essential-only logging at 95% budget
5. **Trace-Aware Suppression**: Rate limiting preserves trace correlation integrity

**Cross-System Coordination**:
- All log sources query centralized rate limiter before writing
- Rate limiter maintains per-system quotas within global budget
- Overflow from one system can "borrow" unused quota from others
- Critical traces bypass rate limiting to maintain debugging capability

### Data Models

From [Source: architecture/data-models.md#log_entries]:
- `log_entries` table with correlation_id, source, level, message, context fields
- Source field supports "client", "worker", "convex", "agent" values
- Context field provides flexible structured data storage

Note: Story 3.1 created enhanced schema with `log_queue` and `recent_log_entries` tables for dual-purpose storage.

### API Specifications

From [Source: architecture/api-implementation-details.md]:
- Cloudflare Workers serve public HTTP API at `/api/v1` endpoints
- Bearer token authentication required for worker endpoints
- No specific logging API documented - this story will establish the pattern

### Component Specifications

From [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Cloudflare Workers code location: Not explicitly defined in current structure
- Convex backend functions: `apps/convex/` directory
- Logging utilities: `apps/web/lib/` for client-side utilities

### File Locations

Based on [Source: architecture/source-tree.md] and Story 3.1 patterns:
- Cloudflare Worker utilities: Create new structure for worker logging
- Convex webhook endpoints: `apps/convex/` directory
- Enhanced logging utilities: `apps/web/lib/console-override.ts` (extend existing)
- Worker proxy fallback: New Cloudflare Worker deployment structure

### Testing Requirements

From [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All code must be fully type-safe (no `any` types)
- Mandatory correlation IDs for request tracking
- No direct `process.env` access - use centralized configuration
- Repository pattern for data access

### Critical Database Load Testing Requirements

**Multi-System Load Testing** (MANDATORY):
- Test sustained high-volume logging from all three systems simultaneously
- Verify rate limiting coordination prevents database quota exhaustion
- Validate cost stays under $10/month with realistic usage patterns
- Test system behavior during log floods from any individual source
- Confirm trace correlation integrity maintained during rate limiting events

**Protection Pattern Testing**:
- Verify adaptive rate limiting works across system boundaries
- Test duplicate detection across different log sources
- Validate sensitive data redaction in all systems
- Confirm suppression patterns prevent development noise flooding

### Technical Constraints

From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Convex 1.12.x for backend functions and database
- Cloudflare Pages/Workers for edge services
- TypeScript 5.4.x with strict mode
- Next.js 14.2.x framework integration

### Pattern Validation

Must follow patterns established in Story 3.1:
- Trace correlation system with consistent trace_id generation
- Non-intrusive logging that preserves system performance
- Environment-based toggling for development/production modes
- Dual-table storage pattern (queue + recent entries)

### Testing

From Story 3.1 testing patterns:
- Unit tests for correlation logic and data transformation
- Integration tests for cross-system log flow
- End-to-end tests for complete trace correlation
- Manual testing across different system boundaries
- Test file locations: `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
