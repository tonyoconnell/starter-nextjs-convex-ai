## Documentation Impact Assessment

This story establishes the foundation for frontend development patterns:

- **Frontend Architecture**: Next.js App Router structure will be established
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Strict mode patterns for React development
- **Tailwind Integration**: CSS-in-JS alternative patterns for styling
- **Development Workflow**: Next.js development server integration with monorepo
- **Testing Foundation**: Basic structure for future component testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From **Story 1.1 - Monorepo & Tooling Initialization**:

- Monorepo structure is established with apps/ and packages/ directories
- Bun 1.2.18 is configured as the primary package manager
- Turborepo 2.5.4 is set up for build orchestration
- TypeScript 5.8.3 with strict mode is configured at root level
- ESLint and Prettier are configured with proper Next.js support needed
- Development tooling foundation is solid and ready for Next.js integration

### Tech Stack Configuration

Based on architecture documents, the following versions and tools must be used:

- **Next.js**: 14.2.x as Full-stack React framework for the web application [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: 5.4.x for type safety and maintainability [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Tailwind CSS**: Latest version for utility-first CSS [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Bun**: 1.1.x as JS Runtime, Package Manager, and Test Runner [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Turborepo**: 2.0.x as High-performance monorepo build system [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements

The Next.js application must be placed in the exact location specified:

```plaintext
apps/web/                 # The Next.js frontend application
├── app/                  # App Router directory structure
│   ├── page.tsx         # Homepage component
│   └── layout.tsx       # Root layout (future story)
├── package.json         # Next.js app dependencies
├── next.config.js       # Next.js configuration
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
├── tailwind.config.js   # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── postcss.config.js    # PostCSS configuration
```

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Component Specifications

The homepage component should align with the component interaction diagram:

**Homepage Component** (`apps/web/app/page.tsx`):

- Server Component by default (App Router pattern)
- Display "Welcome" message as specified in acceptance criteria
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Be prepared for future Convex integration

[Source: architecture/components.md#component-interaction-diagram]

### File Locations

Following the established project structure:

**Next.js Application**:

- `apps/web/` - Main Next.js application directory
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` - Homepage component
- `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout (future)
- `apps/web/next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `apps/web/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration

**Shared Configuration**:

- `packages/config/` - May contain shared TypeScript/ESLint configs
- Root `package.json` - Updated with dev scripts
- Root `turbo.json` - Updated with Next.js dev task

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technical Constraints

From existing project setup and architecture requirements:

**Development Technology**:

- **Next.js App Router**: Must use App Router (not Pages Router)
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Must extend from root strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Must be configured for monorepo structure
- **Bun Integration**: All commands must use Bun package manager
- **Port Management**: Must avoid conflicts with future Convex/Storybook servers

**Performance Requirements**:

- Fast development server startup
- Hot module replacement (HMR) functionality
- Proper TypeScript compilation speed
- Tailwind CSS build optimization

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Coding Standards

The Next.js application must follow established coding standards:

**TypeScript Requirements**:

- Strict mode must be enabled and functional
- No `any` type usage allowed
- Full type safety for all components and functions

**Environment Access**:

- No direct `process.env` access (will be relevant in future stories)
- Use centralized configuration pattern when needed

**Pattern Compliance**:

- Follow React Server Component patterns
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Implement proper error boundaries (future story)

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Requirements

Based on testing strategy, the following will apply in future stories:

**Unit Tests** (future):

- Jest/RTL for component testing
- Test framework integration with Next.js
- Component render and interaction tests

**Integration Tests** (future):

- Next.js app integration with Convex backend
- End-to-end user flows with Playwright

**Test Coverage** (future):

- 90% coverage requirement for shared packages
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Development Workflow Integration

The Next.js app must integrate with existing development workflow:

**Turborepo Integration**:

- Add Next.js dev task to turbo.json
- Configure proper task dependencies
- Enable parallel execution with other tasks

**Development Scripts**:

- `bun run dev` - Start Next.js development server
- `bun run build` - Build Next.js application
- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint on Next.js files
- `bun run type-check` - Run TypeScript checking

**Port Management**:

- Next.js dev server on port 3000 (default)
- Avoid conflicts with Convex dev server (future)
- Avoid conflicts with Storybook (future)

## Pattern Validation

Reference existing patterns that must be followed during implementation:

- Check docs/patterns/ for established architectural patterns (when available)
- Validate against existing examples in docs/examples/ (when available)
- Note any pattern deviations that need discussion
- Identify new patterns that might emerge and should be documented

This story will establish the foundational frontend patterns for:

- Next.js App Router structure
- TypeScript configuration in monorepo
- Tailwind CSS integration patterns
- Development server configuration

## Testing

List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:

- **Test Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library (RTL) for future unit and integration testing [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Coverage**: 90% coverage requirement will apply to shared packages in future stories [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Integration**: All tests must be integrated into CI/CD pipeline (will be implemented in story 1.6) [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

For this foundational story, testing involves:

- Verify Next.js application starts successfully
- Test that development server runs without errors
- Validate TypeScript compilation works correctly
- Confirm Tailwind CSS styles are applied properly
- Test that monorepo integration functions as expected
