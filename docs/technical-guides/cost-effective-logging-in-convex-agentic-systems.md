# üìÑ Research Report: Cost-Effectiveness of Logging in Convex for Agentic Systems

## Objective

To analyze the **cost implications** and **best practices** for managing log data in a **Convex-based edge-first application**, ensuring AI agents can access meaningful feedback loops from logs **without exceeding a \$10/month budget** at small scale.

## 1. üîç Convex Pricing Model Analysis (Professional Plan)

Convex offers a flexible usage-based pricing model. For write-heavy, log-ingestion workloads, the most relevant components are:

| Resource Type    | Monthly Quota (Pro Plan) | Overage Cost              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Document Storage | 50‚ÄØGB                    | \$0.20 per GB/month       |
| Document Writes  | 25‚ÄØM writes              | \$2.00 per million writes |
| Function Calls   | 25‚ÄØM calls               | \$2.00 per million calls  |
| Action Compute   | 250‚ÄØGB-hours             | \$0.30 per GB-hour        |

Notes:

* Writes are typically performed via **function calls** and are billed accordingly.
* **Action compute** usage applies to background or long-running server-side functions.
* Lightweight log writes usually incur very **low compute costs**, but can accumulate at scale.

## 2. üß± Logging Architecture Patterns

### Pattern A: **Direct Logging in Convex**

* **Approach**: Each log line is written directly into a `logs` table via a Convex mutation.
* **Pros**:

  * Simple architecture with no external dependencies.
  * All logs accessible in one place for querying and AI inspection.
  * Minimal dev ops effort.
* **Cons**:

  * Costs scale linearly with log volume.
  * Can quickly exceed budget as traffic grows.
  * Less efficient for long-term storage, querying, or alerting.

---

### Pattern B: **Hybrid Logging (Recommended)**

* **Approach**: Use a low-cost logging backend (e.g., **Logflare**, already in stack) for full raw ingestion. Convex only stores **critical events**, **normalized errors**, or **aggregated summaries** needed for agent feedback.
* **Pros**:

  * Reduces Convex costs significantly.
  * Enables more powerful analysis and retention options in Logflare.
  * Keeps AI agents focused on signal, not noise.
* **Cons**:

  * Slightly more complex (two systems).
  * Requires integration and syncing summarized data into Convex.

## 3. üßÆ Cost Estimation ‚Äì Pattern A (Direct Logging)

### Assumptions:

* **Users per day**: 1,000
* **Logs per user session**: 50
* **Days per month**: 30
* **Log entry size**: 1 KB
* **TTL/Retention**: 30 days

### Calculations:

| Metric                            | Value                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Total log entries                 | 1,000 √ó 50 √ó 30 = 1.5M              |
| Total storage                     | 1.5M √ó 1 KB = 1.43 GB               |
| Function calls (mutations)        | 1.5M                                |
| Action compute (light usage est.) | \~1s √ó 1.5M entries ‚Üí \~30 GB-hours |

### Monthly Cost Breakdown (Convex):

| Cost Component     | Rate               | Estimated Cost    |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Document Storage   | \$0.20 per GB      | \$0.29            |
| Writes             | \$2.00 per million | \$3.00            |
| Function Calls     | \$2.00 per million | \$3.00            |
| Compute (est.)     | \$0.30 per GB-hour | \$0.00‚Äì\$2.00     |
| **Total Estimate** |                    | **\$6.29‚Äì\$8.29** |

‚ö†Ô∏è Costs scale linearly. At 5√ó usage, expect \~\$30‚Äì\$40/month.

## 4. üí° Cost Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy                   | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Log Sampling**        | Only store selected logs (errors, warnings, key events) in Convex.                                   |
| **2. Batch Writes**        | Aggregate multiple logs into a single mutation to reduce write overhead.                             |
| **3. TTL & Auto-Deletion** | Automatically remove logs after 7‚Äì30 days using scheduled deletes.                                   |
| **4. Log Pre-Aggregation** | Store only daily/hourly summaries or key incidents.                                                  |
| **5. Offload Raw Logs**    | Use Logflare or Cloudflare Workers KV for full logs, and keep Convex focused on agent-relevant data. |

## 5. ‚úÖ Recommendation

### Use Pattern B ‚Äî **Hybrid Logging**

**Why**:

* Keeps total Convex cost consistently under \$10/month.
* Offloads long-term or verbose log data to a purpose-built, low-cost system.
* Still enables powerful AI feedback loops using enriched or filtered logs.
* Aligns with best practices for observability in modern agentic architectures.

**How**:

* Route logs from Cloudflare Worker or application code into **Logflare** (already in stack).
* Normalize & summarize logs in the background (daily job or stream processor).
* Push only **insights**, **incidents**, and **traceable identifiers** into Convex.

---

## 6. üìå Actionable Steps

1. **Set up Logflare logging** for raw edge log ingestion.
2. **Define critical log events** to forward to Convex:

   * Exceptions
   * Agent output summaries
   * Security warnings
   * User-reported issues
3. **Write a `logIncident()` Convex mutation** to store just normalized insights.
4. **Configure TTL** for logs: e.g., delete after 14 or 30 days using scheduled mutation.
5. **Add alerting/monitoring** to Logflare for anomalies or error spikes.

---

## 7. üî≠ Future Optimizations

* Compress log payloads before writing (if batch writing JSON arrays).
* Use a **Convex Sharded Counter** or **metrics table** for AI training stats vs raw logs.
* Explore **Convex Data Exports** (if needed) for long-term snapshots.
* For higher scale: consider Datalog-like event systems or third-party analytics layers.
