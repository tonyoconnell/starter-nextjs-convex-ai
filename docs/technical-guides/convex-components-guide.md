**Convex Components & Architecture Patterns**

Convex is a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform designed to make it easy to build full-stack reactive applications with minimal setup. It combines a real-time database, serverless functions, and authentication, all managed within a TypeScript-first developer experience.

---

## ðŸ”§ Core Features

1. **Reactive Database**

   * Document-based (like Firebase or MongoDB)
   * All queries are reactive: clients auto-update on data change
   * Queries written in TypeScript, securely executed from client

2. **Serverless Functions**

   * Write logic with `query()` and `mutation()` in TypeScript
   * Fully managed environment, async and npm-ready

3. **Authentication**

   * Built-in support for GitHub, Google, JWT, etc.
   * Access control via roles and TypeScript logic

4. **Real-time React Integration**

   * Use hooks like `useQuery()` and `useMutation()`
   * Automatic reactivity without polling

5. **File Storage**

   * Upload and serve files via Convex's native file API

---

## âœ… Benefits

* **Full-stack in one repo** â€” unified client + server code
* **Type safety everywhere** â€” auto-inferred TypeScript types
* **Live collaboration** â€” perfect for reactive shared UIs
* **Zero backend ops** â€” no infrastructure to manage

---

## ðŸ§  Ideal Use Cases

* Collaborative tools (whiteboards, CRMs)
* Real-time dashboards
* AI assistants and agents with UIs
* Internal tools
* MVPs and fast-moving startups

---

## ðŸ§° Developer Experience

* CLI: `npx convex dev`, `convex deploy`
* File-based routing in `convex/functions/`
* Hot reload and codegen

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Tech Stack with Convex

* **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind, ShadCN)
* **Backend**: Convex (queries, mutations, auth)
* **DB**: Convex Reactive DB
* **Hosting**: Vercel / Netlify
* **AI**: OpenAI / Langchain / OpenRouter APIs

## ðŸ§± Convex Component Patterns & Examples

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Store text chunks in Convex.
* Use external embedding (e.g., OpenAI) for vector search.
* Query relevant data to enrich LLM prompts.

### 2. Agent State Management

* Agents persist state and memory in Convex.
* Store thoughts, actions, decisions, or queued tasks.
* Useful for multi-agent orchestration.

### 3. Workflow Engine

* Track user or system state across steps.
* Implement UI wizards, multi-step processes, or backend orchestration.

### 4. RESEND Integration

* Use `action()` to send transactional emails via [Resend](https://resend.com).
* Templates and metadata stored in Convex DB.

### 5. Rate Limiter

* Log actions per user/IP in a `rate_limit_log` table.
* Throttle usage based on time windows.

### 6. Presence Tracking

* Store online status and activity with periodic `heartbeat` mutations.
* Clean stale users via CRON or TTL.

### 7. Shard Counter

* Distribute counter writes across documents.
* Reduce write contention for high-frequency actions.

### 8. Aggregates

* Pre-compute totals or metrics on write or via CRON.
* Store in `aggregates` table for fast retrieval.

### 9. Geo Spatial

* Store lat/lng coordinates.
* Filter using bounding box or Haversine formula in `query()`.

### 10. Collaborative State

* Real-time data syncing between clients using `useQuery()`.
* Ideal for shared editors, dashboards, or Kanban boards.

### 11. Text Sync

* Implement collaborative editors.
* Use patching or CRDT integration (e.g., Y.js, Automerge).

### 12. Twilio Integration

* Use `action()` to trigger SMS, voice, or calls.
* Store Twilio credentials in Convex secrets.

### 13. Action Cache

* Cache expensive results (e.g., LLM outputs or API calls).
* Store and reuse if recent.

## ðŸ§  Pro Tips for Power Users

* **Keep functions modular**: Extract logic into helpers to reuse across queries/mutations.
* **Use `action()` only for side effects**: Never access Convex DB from `action()`â€”use `mutation()` instead.
* **Cache external calls**: Store expensive API/LLM results to reduce latency and cost.
* **Enable real-time debugging**: Use admin-only logs or metadata capture for audit/debug workflows.
* **Pair with AI tools**: Store prompts, outputs, and feedback for fine-tuning and diagnostics.
* **Simulate queues and delays**: Combine CRON + timestamps for task scheduling without true queues.

## Additional Patterns & Utilities

### Session & Auth Metadata

* Extend session objects with onboarding or billing metadata.

### Temporal Logic

* Schedule tasks via CRON and timestamps.
* Simulate delays or expiry windows.

### Webhook Listener

* Handle external webhooks via `action()`.
* Persist events and trigger downstream flows.

### Settings & Feature Flags

* Store per-user or global flags in a settings table.
* Toggle features dynamically.

### Stripe Billing

* Handle Stripe webhooks and store subscription data.
* Sync feature access with Convex roles/fields.

### Job Queues

* Store jobs in DB and process with CRON.
* Mark status: `pending`, `processing`, `done`, `failed`.

### Audit & Event Logs

* Track system and user actions.
* Include metadata for compliance or debugging.

### Notification System

* Store and serve real-time in-app alerts.
* Extend with Resend or Twilio for multi-channel support.

### Chat Threads

* Store messages and participants.
* Support real-time threaded conversations.

### Agent Memory Store

* Structured memory (facts, chat logs, serialized context).
* Used to reconstruct prompts or plan next actions.

### Schema-less Meta Store

* Use JSON blobs for flexible schema needs.
* Good for dynamic forms or user-generated config.

### Encrypted or Redacted Fields

* Protect sensitive data with role-based access.
* Mask or encrypt fields based on context.
