# Template Development Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the development of **this template itself**, not applications built from it.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **For Template Users**: If you're creating a new project from this template, you should **delete this entire directory** (`docs/template-development/`) from your project. This content is only relevant for those working on improving the template.

## Template Development Process

This section documents how this template was built using the BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development) methodology.

### üìã Product Requirements

**[prd/](./prd/)**

- **[PRD Overview](./prd.md)** - Complete product requirements document
- **[Epic Breakdown](./prd/)** - Sharded requirements by development phase

### üìñ Development Stories

**[stories/](./stories/)**

Individual development stories that built this template:

- Story-by-story implementation tracking
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Implementation patterns and lessons

### üéØ Project Vision

- **[-file-list.md](./-file-list.md)** - File organization reference
- **[MOCK.md](./MOCK.md)** - Mock data and testing utilities
- **[development-server-startup-guide.md](./development-server-startup-guide.md)** - Template-specific development setup

## Development Methodology

This template was built using:

1. **BMAD Context Engineering** - AI-first development methodology
2. **Sharded Documentation** - Documentation split for AI agent consumption
3. **Story-Driven Development** - Feature implementation through user stories
4. **Knowledge-Driven Development (KDD)** - Systematic knowledge capture and reuse

## For Template Contributors

If you're contributing to this template:

1. **Review the PRD** - Understand the template's goals and scope
2. **Study Implementation Stories** - See how features were built
3. **Follow BMAD Patterns** - Use established development methodology
4. **Document New Features** - Add stories and update requirements

## Template vs Application Development

### Template Development (This Directory)

- Building and improving the starter template itself
- Creating reusable patterns and components
- Establishing development methodologies
- Documenting template setup and usage

### Application Development (Main `docs/`)

- Building specific applications using the template
- Implementing business logic and features
- Customizing for specific use cases
- Maintaining application-specific documentation

**Note**: This template development documentation represents a complete BMAD methodology implementation example, showing how AI-assisted development can create production-ready foundation code through structured collaboration between human architects and AI development agents.
