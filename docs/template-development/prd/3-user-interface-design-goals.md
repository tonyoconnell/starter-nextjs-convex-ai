# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### **Overall UX Vision**

To provide a clean, intuitive, and highly functional interface that serves as both a practical tool and a clear educational reference for developers. The user experience should feel fast, responsive, and modern.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

- **Real-time Interactivity:** UI elements should update in real-time without manual refreshes.
- **Command Palette:** A keyboard-driven command palette (e.g., CMD+K) will be implemented for quick navigation and actions.
- **Agent-Native Controls:** Standard UI controls will be designed to support 'Human-in-the-Loop' (HITL) and AI-driven interactions.

### **Core Screens and Views**

The demonstrative application will include: A Dashboard/Homepage, Authentication screens, a Chatbot Interface, a Component Showcase page, a Settings page for theme/mode switching, and a "Live Log Stream" view.

### **Accessibility, Branding, and Platforms**

- **Accessibility Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
- **Branding:** Minimalist, professional, and developer-focused, designed to be a "blank-slate" that is easy to customize.
- **Target Platforms:** Web Responsive.
