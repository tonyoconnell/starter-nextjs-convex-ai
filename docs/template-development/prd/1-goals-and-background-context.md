# 1. Goals and Background Context

### **Goals**

This Product Requirements Document outlines the features and epics required to build the v1.0 Agentic Starter Template. The primary goals are:

- To create a production-grade starter template that accelerates the development of AI-native applications.
- To codify a robust set of best practices for building, testing, and maintaining applications within an agentic development workflow.
- To provide a foundational platform that makes it easy for developers to implement advanced features like real-time data flow, AI-driven feedback loops, and interactive chat interfaces.

### **Background Context**

As established in our Project Brief, the fundamental challenge this project addresses is the "Context Engineering Gap." We are creating a starter template designed for developers acting as "Context Engineers," who direct AI agents to build applications. This PRD translates that vision into a specific, actionable development plan for the MVP. It uses our approved `Project Brief` and `Architecture Document` as its source of truth.
