## Story 5.1: Implement UI Theme Customizer

_As a developer, I want a simple UI to change core branding elements like colors and fonts, so I can quickly customize the template for a new project._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

## Story 5.2: Persist User Theme Settings

## Story 5.3: Build the Observability Showcase

_As a developer, I want a simple page to demonstrate that our observability tools are working, so I can trust that errors and events are being captured._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A new page is created at `/debug/observability`.
2.  The page contains buttons to trigger a sample Sentry error and a sample PostHog event.
3.  The page includes links to the project's Sentry and PostHog dashboards for verification.

## Story 5.4: Create Initial Database Seeding Scripts

_As a developer, I want a baseline database seeding script, so I can easily populate my development environment with realistic test data._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A new script is created in `packages/agent-scripts/seed.ts`.
2.  The script uses `Faker.js` to generate a sample set of data.
3.  A `bun run seed` command is added to execute the script.
4.  The development database is successfully populated after running the script.
