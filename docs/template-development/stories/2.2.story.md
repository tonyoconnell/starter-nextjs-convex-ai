# Story 2.2: Set Up Storybook Environment

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE**

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a Storybook environment set up for our shared UI package,
**so that** I can develop, test, and document components in isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Storybook is initialized in a new `packages/storybook` directory.
2. It is configured to find and display components from the `packages/ui` directory.
3. A sample story is created for the `Button` component.
4. The Storybook instance can be run locally using a dedicated script (e.g., `bun run storybook`).

## Documentation Impact Assessment

This story establishes the foundation for component documentation and development workflows:

- **Development Patterns**: Enables isolated component development and testing
- **Documentation Strategy**: Provides living documentation for UI component library
- **Quality Assurance**: Enables visual regression testing and component validation
- **Knowledge Capture**: Component usage patterns and design system documentation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 completion, we have established:

- ShadCN/UI components integrated in `packages/ui` with Button, Card, and Input components [Source: story 2.1]
- Shared UI package structure with proper TypeScript configuration [Source: story 2.1]
- Working component imports and exports through `packages/ui/index.ts` [Source: story 2.1]
- Jest unit testing configuration for UI components [Source: story 2.1]

### Technical Context

**Data Models**: No specific data models required for Storybook setup. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**API Specifications**: No API endpoints required for this story.

**Component Specifications**: [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Storybook version: 8.1.x specified in tech stack
- Must integrate with existing ShadCN/UI Button component from packages/ui
- Should support all Button variants: default, secondary, destructive, outline, ghost, link [Source: story 2.1 implementation]
- Components use Tailwind CSS for styling integration [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**File Locations**: Based on project structure guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- Storybook package: `packages/storybook/` (dedicated Storybook environment)
- UI components source: `packages/ui/src/` (existing shared component library)
- Button component: `packages/ui/src/button.tsx` (established in Story 2.1)
- Story files: `packages/storybook/src/stories/` or co-located with components
- Configuration: `packages/storybook/.storybook/` (Storybook configuration directory)

**Testing Requirements**: Following test strategy standards [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:

- Unit tests for Storybook configuration using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test file locations: `packages/storybook/__tests__/` or co-located test files
- Coverage targets: 85%+ statements, 80%+ branches for new Storybook package
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting (not `bun test`)
- Verify component stories render correctly in isolation

**Technical Constraints**:

- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- No use of `any` type allowed [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#typescript-requirements]
- Follow established file naming conventions [Source: CLAUDE.md#important-conventions]
- Storybook version must match tech stack specification (8.1.x) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Notes

Based on architecture guidance [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:

- ✅ `packages/storybook/` directory is defined in the official source tree structure
- ✅ Aligns with monorepo pattern established in Epic 1
- ✅ Separates Storybook environment from main UI package for clean organization
- ✅ Follows established pattern of dedicated package directories

**No structural conflicts identified** - the story requirements align perfectly with the defined architecture.

### Testing Strategy

**Test Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Use Jest with React Testing Library for Storybook configuration testing
- Create tests for story rendering and component discovery
- Use `npx jest --coverage` for accurate coverage reporting
- Coverage targets: 85% statements, 80% branches for packages/storybook
- Test user interactions within story environment

**Test File Locations**: `packages/storybook/__tests__/` or co-located with configuration

**Testing Frameworks**:

- Jest for test runner and assertions [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- React Testing Library for component story testing [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Storybook testing utilities for story validation

**Specific Testing Requirements**:

- Configuration loading and TypeScript path resolution
- Component story rendering without errors
- UI package component discovery and import resolution
- Button story displays all variants correctly
