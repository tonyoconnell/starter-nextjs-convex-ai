# Story 4.1.5: Integrate BetterAuth with Convex Backend

## Status

Complete

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** BetterAuth to be properly integrated with the Convex backend,
**so that** all Convex functions receive authenticated user context instead of anonymous users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Convex client is configured to pass BetterAuth session tokens to the backend.
2. All Convex functions (queries, mutations, actions) receive proper authenticated user context.
3. User identity is correctly mapped between BetterAuth and Convex user records.
4. Authentication state is synchronized between frontend and backend in real-time.
5. Existing features (admin panel, logging, chat) work with authenticated user context.
6. Anonymous access is properly handled with graceful fallbacks.
7. Session token refresh and expiration are handled correctly.
8. All existing authentication flows (login, logout, OAuth) continue to work seamlessly.

## Documentation Impact Assessment

**Architectural Patterns Established:**

- BetterAuth + Convex authentication integration patterns
- Session token lifecycle management in full-stack applications
- User context propagation in serverless functions
- Authentication middleware patterns for Convex
- Frontend-backend authentication synchronization

**Documentation Updates Needed:**

- Update `docs/architecture/authentication-architecture.md` with Convex integration
- Add authentication flow diagrams showing BetterAuth → Convex flow
- Update `docs/technical-guides/` with BetterAuth + Convex setup guide
- Document session management and token handling patterns
- Add troubleshooting guide for authentication issues

**Knowledge Capture:**

- BetterAuth session token structure and validation
- Convex authentication middleware implementation patterns
- User identity mapping between authentication providers
- Performance considerations for authenticated Convex functions
- Security best practices for token handling

**Examples to Create:**

- BetterAuth + Convex integration code examples
- Authentication middleware usage patterns
- User context handling in different function types
- Session management and refresh examples
- Authentication error handling patterns

## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture

**Key Integration Points:**

- **Frontend**: ConvexProvider needs BetterAuth session integration
- **Backend**: Convex functions need authentication middleware
- **Session Management**: Token validation and user context extraction
- **User Mapping**: BetterAuth IDs ↔ Convex user records

### Current State Analysis

**What's Working:**

- ✅ BetterAuth frontend authentication (Google OAuth, email/password)
- ✅ Convex backend functions (but seeing users as "anonymous")
- ✅ Custom auth provider with session management

**What's Broken:**

- ❌ Convex functions can't identify authenticated users
- ❌ Chat system shows "anonymous" instead of real user context
- ❌ LLM access control can't validate user permissions
- ❌ Admin features may have inconsistent user attribution

### Dependencies

**Blocked Stories:**

- Story 4.2 (Knowledge Ingestion Service) - needs authenticated user context
- Future stories requiring user-specific data

**Required Before Starting:**

- Understanding of current BetterAuth implementation
- Convex authentication middleware design decisions
- Token security and performance requirements

### Integration Patterns to Implement

**1. Token Extraction Pattern**

```typescript
// Extract BetterAuth session token in ConvexProvider
const authToken = getAuthToken(); // from BetterAuth
const convexClient = new ConvexReactClient(url, { auth: authToken });
```

**2. Authentication Middleware Pattern**

```typescript
// Convex function with user context
export const authenticatedFunction = query({
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(ctx);
    // Function logic with user context
  },
});
```

**3. User Mapping Pattern**

```typescript
// Map BetterAuth user to Convex user record
const convexUser = await mapBetterAuthUser(betterAuthUser);
```

### Testing Strategy

**Integration Tests:**

- Login → Convex function call → proper user context
- Logout → Convex function call → anonymous handling
- Session expiration → token refresh → continued functionality

**Security Tests:**

- Token tampering protection
- Session hijacking prevention
- CSRF protection validation

### Success Criteria

**Before:**

- Chat shows "anonymous" user
- Admin functions lack user context
- LLM access control fails

**After:**

- Chat identifies real authenticated users
- All features work with proper user attribution
- LLM access control validates user permissions correctly

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Context

Created to resolve authentication integration blocker discovered during Story 4.2 implementation. This story addresses the fundamental issue where BetterAuth handles frontend authentication but Convex backend sees all users as "anonymous".

### Priority

**Critical** - Blocks completion of Story 4.2 and all future stories requiring authenticated user context.
