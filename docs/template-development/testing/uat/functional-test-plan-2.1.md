- [ ] `input.tsx` - Input component with proper styling and ref forwarding
- [ ] All components exported from `index.ts` with proper TypeScript types

**Pass Criteria:** All three component families implemented with proper ShadCN styling

**Test Steps:**

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Locate "ðŸŽ¨ ShadCN Components Showcase" section
3. Test all button variants render and are clickable
4. Test input component accepts text and shows feedback
5. Verify card component displays properly with all sub-components
6. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
7. Verify dark/light theme compatibility (if theme toggle available)

**Expected Results:**

**Button Testing:**

- [ ] **Default Button**: Blue primary button renders correctly
- [ ] **Secondary Button**: Gray secondary button renders correctly
- [ ] **Outline Button**: Outlined button with hover effects
- [ ] **Ghost Button**: Transparent button with hover background
- [ ] **Destructive Button**: Red destructive button (smaller size)
- [ ] All buttons respond to hover and click events

**Input Testing:**

- [ ] Input field renders with placeholder "Type something..."
- [ ] Typing in input displays "You typed: [text]" feedback below
- [ ] Input styling matches ShadCN design patterns
- [ ] Focus states and accessibility features work properly

**Card Testing:**

- [ ] Card container renders with proper border and shadow
- [ ] Card Header displays "Example Card" title
- [ ] Card Description shows descriptive text
- [ ] Card Content displays informational paragraph
- [ ] Card Action button ("Card Action") renders and functions
- [ ] Overall card layout is visually appealing and properly spaced

**Pass Criteria:** All components render correctly and function as expected

## Component-Specific Functional Tests

### Button Component Detailed Testing

**Test Steps:**

1. Click each button variant and verify visual feedback
2. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
3. Verify button states (normal, hover, focus, active)
4. Check button sizing and spacing consistency

**Expected Results:**

- [ ] Visual feedback on hover (color changes)
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility fully functional
- [ ] Consistent sizing and proper spacing
- [ ] All variant styles distinct and appropriate

### Input Component Detailed Testing

**Test Steps:**
