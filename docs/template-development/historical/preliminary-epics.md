#### **Functional Requirements (FR)**

1.  **FR1: Pre-configured Project Scaffolding.** The starter shall provide a complete, production-ready project structure based on the defined edge-first tech stack (Next.js, Cloudflare, Convex, etc.), including all necessary configuration files.
2.  **FR2: Agentic Workflow Integration.** The framework must include built-in hooks, scripts, documentation patterns, and **data feedback loops** (from development, production, and user input) to enable seamless, self-improving integration with a team of AI agents.
3.  **FR3: Automated SDLC Pipeline with Feedback Loop.** The template will include a pre-configured CI/CD pipeline that not only automates linting, testing, and deployment, but also **feeds telemetry and user feedback data back into the agentic development loop** for continuous system improvement.
4.  **FR4: Demonstrative Example Application.** The starter must include a functional example application that demonstrates core patterns and showcases key features, including:
    - **a.** Basic AI functionality (e.g., a conversational chatbot with simple, callable AI agent tools).
    - **b.** Essential cross-cutting concerns: authentication, light/dark mode, and a responsive set of example UI components.
    - **c.** An example of in-app, AI-assisted code or documentation generation using a modern AI SDK.
5.  **FR5: Adaptable Agentic Methodology Guidelines.** The project shall include **guidelines, tutorials, and standardized document templates** for a chosen agentic development methodology (e.g., the BMad-Method), but designed to be adaptable for other emerging frameworks to avoid vendor lock-in.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

1.  **NFR1: Elite Performance.** The deployed starter application must achieve top-tier performance scores (e.g., >95 on Google PageSpeed Insights for Core Web Vitals) by default, leveraging its edge-first architecture.
2.  **NFR2: High Code Quality & Maintainability.** The codebase must enforce strict linting rules, be well-documented, and follow industry best practices to ensure high maintainability by both human and AI developers.
3.  **NFR3: Exceptional Developer Experience (DX).** The local development environment shall provide an exceptional Developer Experience, including a single-command setup, live hot-reloading, and **automated pathways for development telemetry to inform documentation and code generation.**
4.  **NFR4: Security by Default.** The starter must incorporate security best practices out-of-the-box, including secure environment variable management, dependency scanning, and robust authentication patterns.
5.  **NFR5: Comprehensive Testability.** The starter must be architected for high testability, with clear patterns for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
6.  **NFR6: Cost-Effectiveness.** The deployed starter application must be highly cost-effective, with baseline operational costs designed to be minimal (ideally under $10/month). The framework's documentation must include robust cost management recommendations and guidelines.

### **Confirmation**

I believe this revised version is much stronger and more accurately reflects the project's ambitious goals.

Please review this updated draft. If it now fully captures the requirements, we can give it our final approval and proceed to the next section: **User Interface Design Goals.**
