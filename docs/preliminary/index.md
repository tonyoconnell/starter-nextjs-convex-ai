# Preliminary Documentation

This folder contains the early planning and exploratory documents created during the initial phases of the project. These documents represent the foundational thinking that led to the current architecture and implementation approach.

## Contents

- **[preliminary-tech-stack.md](./preliminary-tech-stack.md)** - Initial technology stack exploration and decisions
- **[preliminary-epics.md](./preliminary-epics.md)** - Early feature breakdown and epic definitions

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
- Historical context for architectural decisions
- Reference for the evolution of project requirements
- Foundation that informed the final PRD and Architecture documents

## Note

While these documents contain valuable insights, the authoritative sources for current project direction are:
- [Project Brief](../project-brief.md)
- [PRD](../prd.md)  
- [Architecture](../architecture.md)

The preliminary documents helped shape these final artifacts but may contain outdated or superseded information.
