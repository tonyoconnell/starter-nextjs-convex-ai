# 2. Requirements

### **Functional Requirements (FR)**
1.  **FR1: Pre-configured Project Scaffolding.** The starter shall provide a complete, production-ready project structure based on the defined edge-first tech stack (Next.js, Cloudflare, Convex, etc.), including all necessary configuration files.
2.  **FR2: Agentic Workflow Integration.** The framework must include built-in hooks, scripts, documentation patterns, and data feedback loops (from development, production, and user input) to enable seamless, self-improving integration with a team of AI agents.
3.  **FR3: Automated SDLC Pipeline with Feedback Loop.** The template will include a pre-configured CI/CD pipeline that not only automates linting, testing, and deployment, but also feeds telemetry and user feedback data back into the agentic development loop for continuous system improvement.
4.  **FR4: Demonstrative Example Application.** The starter must include a functional example application that demonstrates core patterns and showcases key features, including:
    * a. Basic AI functionality (e.g., a conversational chatbot with simple, callable AI agent tools).
    * b. Essential cross-cutting concerns: authentication, light/dark mode, and a responsive set of example UI components.
    * c. An example of in-app, AI-assisted code or documentation generation using a modern AI SDK.
5.  **FR5: Pluggable Agentic Methodology Engine.** The project shall be architected to allow its core agent instruction set (which includes templates, prompts, and workflows) to be replaced by other similar structured frameworks.

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**
1.  **NFR1: Elite Performance.** The deployed starter application must achieve top-tier performance scores (e.g., >95 on Google PageSpeed Insights for Core Web Vitals) by default.
2.  **NFR2: High Code Quality & Maintainability.** The codebase must enforce strict linting rules, be well-documented, and follow industry best practices.
3.  **NFR3: Exceptional Developer Experience (DX).** The local development environment shall provide an exceptional Developer Experience, including a single-command setup, live hot-reloading, and automated pathways for development telemetry.
4.  **NFR4: Security by Default.** The starter must incorporate security best practices out-of-the-box.
5.  **NFR5: Comprehensive Testability.** The starter must be architected for high testability, with clear patterns for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
6.  **NFR6: Cost-Effectiveness.** The deployed starter application must be highly cost-effective, with baseline operational costs designed to be minimal (ideally under $10/month).
