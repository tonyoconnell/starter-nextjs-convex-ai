# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### **Overall UX Vision**
To provide a clean, intuitive, and highly functional interface that serves as both a practical tool and a clear educational reference for developers. The user experience should feel fast, responsive, and modern.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**
* **Real-time Interactivity:** UI elements should update in real-time without manual refreshes.
* **Command Palette:** A keyboard-driven command palette (e.g., CMD+K) will be implemented for quick navigation and actions.
* **Agent-Native Controls:** Standard UI controls will be designed to support 'Human-in-the-Loop' (HITL) and AI-driven interactions.

### **Core Screens and Views**
The demonstrative application will include: A Dashboard/Homepage, Authentication screens, a Chatbot Interface, a Component Showcase page, a Settings page for theme/mode switching, and a "Live Log Stream" view.

### **Accessibility, Branding, and Platforms**
* **Accessibility Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
* **Branding:** Minimalist, professional, and developer-focused, designed to be a "blank-slate" that is easy to customize.
* **Target Platforms:** Web Responsive.
