## Script Outline

### Hook (30 seconds)

"I just spent 45 minutes dealing with a CI failure that could have been caught in 30 seconds locally. And I realized I was checking CI status manually dozens of times per day. So I built an automation system that eliminates both problems entirely."

**Visual**: Show terminal with failed CI, then switching to GitHub, then back to terminal - demonstrating the context switching pain.

### Why Important (60 seconds)

**The Problem**:

- Manual CI checking interrupts flow state
- CI failures discovered after 5+ minutes of waiting
- No pre-push validation means preventable failures
- Context switching between terminal and GitHub Actions

**Real Impact**:

- Each CI failure = 15+ minutes of lost productivity
- Manual status checking = 20+ interruptions per day
- No early warning = problems discovered too late

**BMAD Context**:
"In BMAD methodology, we're directing AI agents efficiently. But if our deployment pipeline requires constant manual intervention, we're defeating the purpose of automation."

**Visual**: Show actual GitHub Actions page with recent failures, then demonstrate the manual checking process.

### What/How Implementation (90-120 seconds)

**What I Built**: Three interconnected scripts that automate the entire push-to-deployment cycle.

**Core Components**:

1. **Pre-Push Validation** (`smart-push.sh`)
   - Runs TypeScript, ESLint, and build checks locally
   - Only pushes if all validations pass
   - Prevents 90% of CI failures before they happen

2. **Real-Time CI Monitoring** (`ci-monitor.sh`)
   - Automatically monitors CI after push
   - Provides live status updates every 10 seconds
   - Includes timeout handling and clear exit codes

3. **Quick Status Checking** (`ci-status.sh`)
   - Instant CI status for any branch
   - Shows recent run history
   - Direct links to GitHub Actions

**Integration**:

- Added npm run commands: `bun run push`, `bun run ci:status`, `bun run ci:watch`
- Updated CLAUDE.md so future AI sessions know about these tools
- GitHub CLI integration for seamless authentication

**Key Implementation Details**:

- Error handling for every failure mode
- Timeout management (5-minute default)
- Visual status indicators and progress reporting
- Support for branch-specific monitoring

**Visual**: Show live coding/terminal demonstration of each script in action, then the package.json integration.

### Value for Viewers (30 seconds)

**Immediate Benefits**:

- Zero manual CI checking required
- Catch failures in 30 seconds instead of 5+ minutes
- Never push broken code to CI again
- Know CI status instantly, not after context switching

**BMAD Integration**:
"This fits perfectly into BMAD workflow - your AI agents can focus on implementation while the automation handles deployment validation."

**Quick Implementation**:
"Three scripts, five npm commands, and you're done. Takes 10 minutes to set up, saves hours every week."

**Call to Action**:
"Grab the scripts from the repo, customize the validation steps for your stack, and eliminate CI surprises from your workflow."

**Visual**: Show the final command `bun run push` in action with successful pre-validation and CI monitoring.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified

**Core Scripts** (all executable):

- `scripts/ci-status.sh` - Quick CI status check with GitHub CLI integration
- `scripts/ci-monitor.sh` - Real-time CI monitoring with timeout handling
- `scripts/smart-push.sh` - Pre-validated push with automatic CI monitoring

**Configuration Updates**:

- `package.json` - Added npm run commands for convenient access
- `CLAUDE.md` - Documented CI commands for future development sessions

### Commit References

**Primary Implementation**:

- **Commit**: `c314e57` - feat: add CI monitoring and smart push scripts
- **GitHub Compare**: https://github.com/appydave-templates/starter-nextjs-convex-ai/compare/0b258d9...c314e57
- **Key Changes**: Created complete CI monitoring system with 3 scripts + package.json integration

**Related Context**:

- **Previous Commit**: `0b258d9` - docs: establish YouTube brief methodology
- **Trigger Issue**: CI failures from commit `969177a` (ESLint configuration issues)

### Implementation Context Capture

**Original Problem**:
User experienced CI failure and said "why is push not working, I've given you two attempts and when I do a git status I have files?" This led to discovering broken pre-commit hooks and ESLint configuration issues.

**Solution Development Process**:

1. **Root Cause**: ESLint configuration was missing, causing pre-commit failures
2. **Immediate Fix**: Restored ESLint config, added browser globals, fixed TypeScript issues
3. **Prevention Strategy**: Realized need for automated CI monitoring to prevent future surprises
4. **Automation Design**: Created three-script system for comprehensive CI workflow automation

**Key Decisions Made**:

- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Used `gh` commands instead of API calls for better authentication and formatting
- **Pre-Push Validation**: Include TypeScript, ESLint, and build checks to catch issues locally
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 10-second polling with 5-minute timeout for responsive feedback
- **npm Script Integration**: Made commands easily accessible via `bun run` for BMAD workflow compatibility

**Architecture Choices**:

- **Bash Scripts**: Cross-platform compatibility and easy customization
- **Exit Code Standards**: Proper exit codes for CI integration and error handling
- **Status Reporting**: Visual indicators and clear progress messages for better UX
- **Timeout Management**: Prevent infinite waiting while allowing long CI runs

### Key Code Snippets

**Smart Push Pre-Validation**:

```bash
# Pre-push validation sequence
echo "üìù TypeScript type checking..."
if ! bun run typecheck; then
    echo "‚ùå TypeScript errors found. Please fix before pushing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "üßπ Running ESLint..."
if ! bun run lint; then
    echo "‚ùå ESLint errors found. Please fix before pushing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "üèóÔ∏è  Testing production build..."
if ! bun run build; then
    echo "‚ùå Build failed. Please fix before pushing."
    exit 1
fi
```

**Real-Time CI Status Monitoring**:

```bash
# CI monitoring with timeout
while true; do
    CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)
    ELAPSED=$((CURRENT_TIME - START_TIME))

    if [ $ELAPSED -ge $TIMEOUT ]; then
        echo "‚è∞ Timeout reached after ${TIMEOUT} seconds"
        exit 124
    fi

    STATUS=$(echo "$CI_DATA" | jq -r '.status')
    case "$STATUS" in
        "completed")
            case "$CONCLUSION" in
                "success") echo "‚úÖ CI completed successfully!"; exit 0 ;;
                "failure") echo "‚ùå CI failed!"; exit 1 ;;
            esac ;;
        "in_progress") echo "üîÑ Running: $WORKFLOW" ;;
    esac

    sleep 10
done
```
