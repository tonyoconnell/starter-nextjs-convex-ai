# Development Workflow Patterns

## Overview

This document outlines established patterns for development processes, tooling, team collaboration, and Knowledge-Driven Development (KDD) practices.

## KDD (Knowledge-Driven Development) Patterns

### Documentation Impact Assessment

**Context**: Evaluating documentation needs during story planning
**Implementation**:

- Assess what patterns might be established or validated
- Identify documentation files that might need updating
- Plan what knowledge should be captured for future reference
- Determine what examples should be created from implementation

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Ensures knowledge capture is planned, not reactive

### Pattern Validation Workflow

**Context**: Validating implementation against established patterns
**Implementation**:

- Check `docs/patterns/` for relevant established patterns
- Validate against existing examples in `docs/examples/`
- Note any pattern deviations that need discussion
- Identify new patterns that might emerge and should be documented

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Maintains consistency and captures evolving best practices

### Knowledge Capture Process

**Context**: Systematically capturing lessons learned
**Implementation**:

- Document what worked well in implementation
- Capture challenges encountered and how they were solved
- Note what future developers should know about the approach
- Identify patterns or anti-patterns that were discovered

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Builds institutional knowledge and prevents repeated mistakes

## Story Development Patterns

### Story Planning

**Context**: Planning story implementation for maximum learning
**Implementation**:

- Include Documentation Impact Assessment in story planning
- Reference relevant patterns and examples during planning
- Plan knowledge capture activities upfront
- Identify dependencies on existing patterns

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Sets up stories for successful pattern validation and knowledge capture

### Implementation Workflow

**Context**: Following consistent development process
**Implementation**:

- Validate against patterns before implementation
- Implement task and subtasks systematically
- Document pattern adherence or deviations
- Update story documentation as work progresses

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent quality and captures implementation knowledge

### Quality Review Process

**Context**: Validating both code quality and knowledge capture
**Implementation**:

- Review pattern compliance during QA
- Validate that new patterns are documented
- Ensure reference examples are created where appropriate
- Confirm lessons learned are captured

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Maintains quality standards and ensures knowledge is preserved

## Git Workflow Patterns

### Branch Strategy

**Context**: Managing code changes and collaboration
**Implementation**:

- Use feature branches for story development
- Follow conventional commit messages
- Use pull requests for code review
- Maintain clean commit history

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Enables parallel development and clear change tracking

### Commit Conventions

**Context**: Standardizing commit messages
**Implementation**:

- Use conventional commits format
- Include story references in commits
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Atomic commits for logical changes

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Improves code history readability and enables automation

## Code Review Patterns

### Review Checklist

**Context**: Ensuring consistent code review quality
**Implementation**:

- Validate code against established patterns
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify test coverage and quality
- Ensure documentation is updated

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Maintains code quality and knowledge consistency

### Knowledge Transfer in Reviews

**Context**: Using reviews for learning and pattern evolution
**Implementation**:

- Identify new patterns during review
- Share knowledge about implementation approaches
- Document rationale for significant decisions
- Update patterns based on review insights

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Spreads knowledge across team and evolves best practices

## Testing Workflow Patterns

### Test-Driven Development

**Context**: Writing tests to drive implementation
**Implementation**:

- Write tests before implementation
- Use tests to validate pattern compliance
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Update tests when patterns evolve

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Ensures reliable code and validates pattern effectiveness

### Continuous Testing

**Context**: Running tests throughout development
**Implementation**:

- Run tests on every commit
- Use test results to validate changes
- Maintain fast test feedback loops
- Monitor test coverage trends

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Catches issues early and maintains confidence in changes

## Documentation Workflow Patterns

### Living Documentation

**Context**: Keeping documentation current with implementation
**Implementation**:

- Update documentation as part of development
- Review documentation accuracy during QA
- Use real examples from implementation
- Archive outdated documentation

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Ensures documentation remains useful and accurate

### Pattern Evolution

**Context**: Evolving patterns based on implementation experience
**Implementation**:

- Regular pattern review sessions
- Update patterns based on new learnings
- Deprecate patterns that are no longer effective
- Version control pattern changes

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Keeps patterns relevant and effective

## Collaboration Patterns

### Knowledge Sharing

**Context**: Spreading knowledge across the team
**Implementation**:

- Regular pattern review sessions
- Code pairing for complex implementations
- Documentation reviews
- Cross-training on different areas

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Prevents knowledge silos and improves team capability

### Decision Documentation

**Context**: Recording architectural and implementation decisions
**Implementation**:

- Document significant decisions in ADRs
- Include rationale and alternatives considered
- Update patterns based on decisions
- Review decisions periodically

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Preserves decision context and enables future evaluation

## Tooling Patterns

### Development Environment

**Context**: Standardizing development setup
**Implementation**:

- Use consistent tooling across team
- Document setup procedures
- Automate environment setup where possible
- Keep development environment close to production

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

**Rationale**: Reduces setup friction and environmental issues

### Automation Patterns

**Context**: Automating repetitive development tasks
**Implementation**:

- Automate linting and formatting
- Use git hooks for quality checks
- Automate dependency updates
- Generate boilerplate code where appropriate

**Example**: _(Will be populated from actual implementations)_

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Inconsistent Process Following

- Don't skip KDD steps for "simple" stories
- Avoid inconsistent pattern validation
- Don't defer documentation updates

### Over-Documentation

- Avoid documenting every small decision
- Don't create patterns for one-off solutions
- Keep documentation focused and actionable

### Tool Obsession

- Don't change tools without clear benefits
- Avoid complex tooling for simple problems
- Focus on process over tools

### Knowledge Hoarding

- Share knowledge proactively
- Document tribal knowledge
- Cross-train team members
