# Patterns & Principles Library

This directory contains established architectural patterns, coding principles, and best practices for the project. These patterns emerge from successful implementations and serve as guidelines for future development.

## Pattern Categories

### [Frontend Patterns](frontend-patterns.md)

React, Next.js, and UI component patterns for consistent frontend development.

### [Backend Patterns](backend-patterns.md)

Convex, API, and server-side patterns for robust backend architecture.

### [Testing Patterns](testing-patterns.md)

Testing strategies, patterns, and best practices across all layers.

### [Architecture Patterns](architecture-patterns.md)

System design patterns, project structure, and architectural decisions.

### [Development Workflow Patterns](development-workflow-patterns.md)

Patterns for development processes, tooling, and team collaboration.

## Using This Library

### For Developers

1. **Before Implementation**: Check relevant pattern documents for established approaches
2. **During Development**: Follow documented patterns and conventions
3. **After Implementation**: Identify new patterns that emerged

### For QA Reviews

1. **Pattern Compliance**: Validate implementations follow established patterns
2. **Pattern Evolution**: Document new patterns discovered during review
3. **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Flag approaches that should be avoided

### Pattern Documentation Standards

Each pattern document should include:

- **Context**: When and why to use this pattern
- **Implementation**: How to implement the pattern
- **Examples**: Real code examples from the project
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Related Patterns**: Cross-references to other relevant patterns

## Knowledge-Driven Development (KDD) Integration

This pattern library is a core component of our KDD methodology:

- **Pattern Validation**: Ensures consistency across implementations
- **Knowledge Capture**: Preserves architectural decisions and rationale
- **Continuous Improvement**: Evolves based on real project experience

## Contributing to Patterns

New patterns are identified and documented through:

1. **Story Implementation**: Novel approaches during development
2. **QA Reviews**: Patterns discovered during code review
3. **Retrospectives**: Lessons learned from completed stories
4. **Architecture Evolution**: Changes to system design and structure

## Pattern Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Patterns are reviewed quarterly for relevance
- **Version Control**: All pattern changes are tracked via git
- **Cross-References**: Patterns reference related documentation
- **Validation**: New patterns must include real project examples
