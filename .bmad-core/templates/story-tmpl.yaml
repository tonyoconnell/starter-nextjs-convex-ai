    title: Documentation Impact Assessment
    instruction: |
      Assess the potential documentation impact of this story implementation (KDD - Knowledge-Driven Development):
      - What architectural patterns might be established or validated?

      - What new knowledge should be captured for future reference?
      - Are there examples that should be created from this implementation?

    title: Dev Notes
    instruction: |
      Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
      - Do not invent information
      - If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
      - If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
      - Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks
