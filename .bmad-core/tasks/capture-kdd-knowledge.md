# Capture KDD Knowledge Task

## Purpose

To systematically capture implementation knowledge, patterns, and learnings from completed stories according to Knowledge-Driven Development (KDD) methodology. This ensures valuable insights are preserved and shared for future development.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 1. Load Story Context

- Read the completed story file to understand what was implemented
- Review the Dev Agent Record sections for implementation details
- Identify key technical decisions and solutions implemented

### 2. Identify Implementation Patterns

**New Patterns Discovered:**

- What new architectural patterns emerged during implementation?
- What new coding patterns were established?
- What new deployment or infrastructure patterns were created?
- What integration patterns were discovered?

**Pattern Validation:**

- Which existing patterns were successfully followed?
- Which patterns needed modification or adaptation?
- What anti-patterns were avoided or corrected?

### 3. Capture Technical Learnings

**What Worked Well:**

- Which technical approaches were successful?
- What tools, libraries, or configurations performed well?
- What development workflows proved effective?

**Challenges and Solutions:**

- What technical challenges were encountered?
- How were blockers and issues resolved?
- What alternative approaches were considered?
- What would be done differently next time?

### 4. Document Architecture Impact

**Architecture Updates Needed:**

- Does any architecture documentation need updating based on implementation?
- Were any assumptions in the architecture proven incorrect?
- Do any new architectural components need documenting?

**Dependencies and Integrations:**

- What new dependencies were added and why?
- How do new components integrate with existing architecture?
- What compatibility or version constraints were discovered?

### 5. Create Reusable Knowledge

**Examples and Templates:**

- Should any code examples be extracted for future reference?
- Could any configurations be templated for reuse?
- Are there setup scripts or automation that should be preserved?

**Documentation Updates:**

- What new documentation should be created?
- What existing documentation needs updating?
- What troubleshooting guides would help future developers?

### 6. Identify Future Improvements

**Technical Debt:**

- What technical debt was created that should be addressed?
- What temporary solutions need future improvement?
- What performance or security considerations need follow-up?

**Process Improvements:**

- What development process improvements were identified?
- What tooling or automation could be improved?
- What testing or validation approaches could be enhanced?

### 7. Update Story Documentation

Update the story file with KDD findings in the appropriate sections:

**Dev Agent Record → Completion Notes:**

- Add key technical insights and learnings
- Document important decisions and rationale

**QA Results → Pattern Compliance Review:**

- Document new patterns established
- Note pattern validation results

**QA Results → Knowledge Capture:**

- Add systematic knowledge capture findings
- Include recommendations for future development

### 8. Generate Knowledge Summary

Provide a structured summary of captured knowledge:

#### Technical Patterns Established

- List new patterns with brief descriptions
- Note reusability and applicability

#### Key Learnings

- Summarize most important insights
- Highlight critical success factors

#### Architecture Impact

- Identify any architecture updates needed
- Note integration points and dependencies

#### Recommendations

- Suggest improvements for future stories
- Recommend documentation or template updates

#### Knowledge Assets Created

- List any examples, templates, or guides created
- Note location and purpose of knowledge assets

## Completion Criteria

- All implementation patterns identified and documented
- Technical learnings systematically captured
- Story documentation updated with KDD insights
- Knowledge summary provided for future reference
- Any necessary architecture or template updates identified
